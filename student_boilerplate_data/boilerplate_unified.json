      "simple_general_approach_cate_long": "\n### Moderators and Treatment Policies\n\nIn simple terms, we wanted to see if a treatment works differently for different people, rather than just figuring out one overall benefit for everyone. We used a method called 'causal forests' (think of it like a special type of decision tree) to find which groups of people might benefit the most, and which groups might benefit the least.\n\nBecause some of our measures work in opposite directions ('lower is better', e.g. depression), we flipped those measures so that 'higher' always means 'better.' That way, if we talk about a 'positive effect,' it consistently means the person improved.\n\nTo avoid fooling ourselves by spotting fake patterns in the data, we split our sample in half. We used the first half to teach our causal forest model what to look for, then tested it on the second half—so we only trust what shows up in that new data, where the model wasn’t allowed to 'peek.'\n\nWe tested whether the model’s predictions were sensible in two ways:\n1.  **Do the average predictions match the overall effect?** This checks if the model's idea of an 'average effect' fits what we actually see in the second half of the data.\n2.  **Is there real variety in who benefits most?** The model estimates different effects for different people, but we need to confirm that these differences aren not just random noise.\n\nWe also used two extra tools:\n- **Qini curves**: these plots show if focusing on the people who the model says would benefit most actually leads to better outcomes than just treating (or not treating) everyone.\n- **Policy trees**: these are straightforward 'if-then' rules (e.g., 'If a person’s baseline score is above X, recommend treatment'). Qini curves give more insight than 'black box' machine learning models, and can help guide decisions in real-world practice.\n\nPutting it all together, this step-by-step approach lets us investigate whether treatments should be applied the same way for everyone, or whether we can do better by matching treatments to the people who stand to benefit the most (refer to appendix {{appendix_analytic_approach}}.",
      "strengths_grf_long": "\n### Strengths and Limitations of Our Approach\n\nWe used causal forests [@grf2024]—a statistical method designed to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs)—to investigate how treatment effectiveness might vary across individuals with different characteristics. This strategy offers several advantages over simpler regression models, yet it also comes with important caveats.\n\n#### Potential Limitations\n\nFirst, our results depend heavily on having measured all key variables that affect both who receives treatment and how strongly they respond. If important factors are missing, the estimated differences in treatment effects may be biased. Selecting which characteristics to include in the model is also critical: omitting relevant factors or including inappropriate ones can yield misleading conclusions. Any further analyses that rely on these estimates—such as deciding whom to treat first—will inherit the same potential biases.\n\nSecond, interpreting subgroup effects can be challenging when many characteristics are considered simultaneously. Because these estimates are conditional on all factors in the model, a statistically significant finding for one subgroup may not necessarily hold when additional characteristics vary. Moreover, even if the model detects genuine differences, small or niche effects might not translate into meaningful real-world improvements.\n\n#### Strengths\n\nDespite these considerations, our approach provides a powerful way to uncover and potentially leverage treatment effect heterogeneity. Causal forests [@grf2024] do not assume a simple linear or additive structure, enabling them to detect complex interactions among diverse covariates. To ensure the findings are not just statistical artifacts, we used a {{sample_split}} sample split: one half of the data to build the model and the other to test its predictions on unseen data. This guards against overfitting and gives a more reliable indication of how well the model generalises.\n\nWe also explicitly assess the reliability and practical value of the predicted differences in treatment effects. We perform statistical checks—such as calibration and differential prediction tests [@grf2024]—to determine whether these variations are genuine rather than noise. Additionally, the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) [@grf2024; @wager2018] estimates how much we might improve outcomes if we treat only the individuals predicted to benefit most, instead of treating everyone equally. To visualise this, Qini curves [@grf2024] show how much extra benefit accumulates as we expand treatment from the top-ranked individuals to a larger portion of the population. Finally, policy trees [@policytree_package_2024; @athey2021; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] translate these insights into straightforward ‘if-then’ rules based on key baseline characteristics, making the findings more accessible for real-world decision-making.\n\nIn sum, this combination of flexible modelling, rigorous testing, and practical tools for targeting treatment offers a robust framework for studying and applying treatment effect heterogeneity. Nonetheless, these benefits hinge on the completeness of our data and the accuracy of our assumptions.\n",

    "explain": {
      "grf_long": "\nIn this appendix we show how to estimate causal effects with the `grf` R package (Generalised Random Forests).\n\n#### Menu of HTE diagnostics\n\nInvestigators can choose one, some, or all of the following tools, depending on the scientific or operational question:\n\n* **RATE AUTOC / RATE Qini (global evidence)** – 'Should we abandon a uniform policy at all?'  Tests the null of no actionable heterogeneity on a validation split.\n* **Qini curves (budget lens)** – 'If we can treat only up to $p\\%$, what uplift do we expect?'  Reads the targeting curve at specific spend levels.\n* **Policy trees (decision rule)** – 'Which simple, transparent allocation rule maximises expected welfare under constraints?'  Optimises welfare directly, agnostic to hypothesis-testing conventions.\n\nThese tools are complementary rather than sequential.  A study may stop after RATE, skip RATE and go straight to a decision rule, or report the full trio; the choice should reflect the primary inferential aim — evidence, optimisation, or communication.\n\nBelow we **illustrate** all three analyses in turn.  In practice an investigator may run only the subset that addresses their question.\n\n\nHowever, we begin with the overall average treatment effect (ATE), investigate whether effects vary (heterogeneity), and --where useful -- estimate individualised effects and derive simple, actionable treatment rules.\n\n### Step 1 Estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\n\nThe ATE answers a simple question: on average, how much does treatment change the outcome? In a well‑randomised trial (or an observational study with adequate control), we estimate it with the difference in mean outcomes between treated and control units. Formally,\n\n$${\\rm ATE}=E\\,[Y(1)-Y(0)],$$\n\nwhere $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ denote potential outcomes under treatment and control.\n`grf::average_treatment_effect()` computes the ATE, using doubly‑robust estimation for precision. This step gives us a baseline—say, the new therapy lifts well‑being by 0.25 points (1–7 scale).\n\nWe start here because the ATE tells us whether the treatment works **on average** if everyone were treated versus no-one. Yet a zero (or noisy) ATE does not rule out helpful or harmful effects for sub-groups, and a non-zero ATE does not guarantee benefits for all.  We often want to examine heterogeneity.\n\n\n+### Step 2 Assessing Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)\n\nTreatments seldom work equally for everyone. We define the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for covariate profile $x$ as\n$$\\tau(x)=E\\,[Y(1)-Y(0)\\mid X=x].$$\nIf $\\tau(x)$ is constant, effects are homogeneous; if it varies, we have heterogeneity.\n\nClassical regression tackles heterogeneity via interaction terms, but that approach demands strong functional‐form assumptions. Real‑world heterogeneity can be non‑linear and high‑dimensional; guessing the correct model risks misspecification or over‑fitting [@Sadique2022]. Thus we turn to causal forests, which let the data speak.\n\n\n+### Step 3 Estimating Individualised Effects with Causal Forests\n\nA causal forest is an ensemble of 'honest' causal trees grown to capture **differences** in treatment effects rather than outcome levels [@grf2024]. Each tree splits the data to maximise treated‑versus‑control contrasts within leaves, and the forest averages those leaf‑level estimates to give\n$$\\hat\\tau(x)$$\nfor every individual.\n\n Advantages:\n\n- **Flexibility** – no need to pre‑specify interactions or non‑linearities.\n- **Orthogonalisation** – residualising outcomes and treatment probabilities focuses the forest on causal signal [@wager2018].\n- **Per‑person estimates** – we obtain $\\hat\\tau(x_i)$ for every $i$.\n\n+### Step 4 Honest Estimation and Out-of-Bag Validation\n\nOver‑fitting lurks in flexible models. `grf` combats this with 'honest' trees: one half‑sample picks splits, the other half estimates effects, ensuring each leaf estimate is out‑of‑sample. Out‑of‑bag (OOB) predictions—averaging over trees that did **not** train on an observation—provide further unbiased validation and standard errors [@grf2024].\n\n+### Step 5 Handling Missing Data and Basic Validation\n\nMissing covariate values? No drama. `grf` uses the MIA (Missing Incorporated in Attributes) rule: it treats 'missing' as a legitimate split category, so we keep cases rather than impute or drop them [@grf2024]. Hyper‑parameters rarely need fine‑tuning, though cross‑validation can refine minimum leaf size, tree depth, and the like.\n\n+### Step 6 Global evidence with RATE (AUTOC & Qini)\n\nDo the estimated $\\hat\\tau(x)$ really differ, or is it just noise? The RATE framework answers this. We rank individuals by $\\hat\\tau$ and ask whether treating the top scorers improves outcomes relative to random assignment. The Targeting Operator Characteristic (TOC) curve plots this gain over treatment fractions $q$. Two scalar summaries are\n\n* **AUTOC** – area under the TOC; accentuates extreme responders.\n* **Qini** – a weighted area (weights grow with $q$); favours broader gains [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nUnder $H_0$ (no heterogeneity) both metrics equal zero; `grf::rank_average_treatment_effect()` supplies estimates, standard errors, and $t$‑tests. Rejecting $H_0$ signals actionable heterogeneity.\n\nBoth metrics aggregate the whole targeting curve, so a single negative stretch can drag the average below zero.  Thus a reliably negative RATE warns that *no blanket ranking policy should be adopted*, no matter what the tail behaviour looks like.\n\nRATE therefore answers a *global* question: if we were to use our estimated $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ to prioritise who gets treated **across the entire population**, would outcomes improve compared with treating everyone (or no-one) identically?  If there were no heterogeneity, then any rule based on $X$ (including our $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ estimates) should do no better than random assignment.\n\n+### Step 7 Quantifying policy value with RATE metrics\n\nBeyond significance, AUTOC and Qini quantify the **magnitude** of improvement from targeting. A large AUTOC means a prioritisation rule sharply distinguishes high‑benefit individuals; a large Qini means gains persist over wider coverage. Policymakers can weigh these gains against costs—because budgets rarely stretch to treating everyone (as any Kiwi running a lab grant knows too well).\n\n### Step 8 Budget-constrained gains via Qini curves\n\nRATE tells us whether heterogeneity exists in aggregate; the Qini curve drills down to **how much uplift we get at each spend level**.  A planner who can only afford to treat the top 20 % cares about the leftmost fifth of the curve, even if the global RATE is negative.\n\n*Practical note:* because the Qini curve is read off the **same validation split** used for RATE, comparisons are on equal footing and over-optimism is kept in check.\n\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\n#| label: fig-example-qini\n#| fig-cap: \"Example Qini Curve.\"\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-width: 12\n#| fig-height: 12\nmodels_binary_batch_example$model_t2_agreeableness_z$policy_tree\n\n```\n\n\nIn the above illustration, the Qini curve rises sharply at the beginning, indicating that the first several percent of individuals treated (those with the highest predicted $\tau(x)$) yield a large gains to agreeableness. By contrast, the dashed line is roughly a 35-degree line starting at (0,0) – it represents a policy that doesn’t use the heterogeneity (just treating people arbitrarily), which yields, on average, a linear accumulation of the overall ATE. At $x=1.0$ (100% treated), both the model-based policy and the random policy coincide – at that point, everyone is treated, so the total gain is just the ATE. The fact that the Qini curve is above the solid line (forming a 'bulge') indicates that targeting is effective: we achieve more outcome gain for the same treatment fraction [@grf2024]. The area between the solid curve and dashed line up to a certain point corresponds to the RATE metrics discussed (QINI would be the total area between them from 0 to 1).\n\nIn our analysis, we report budget-constrained thresholds for treating the top 20% or 50% of recipients. Policymakers often have limits on how many people can be treated (due to cost or other constraints). The Qini curve allows us to zoom in on specific treatment fractions. For instance, if we can only treat 20% of the population, we look at $q = 0.2$ on the x-axis. The y-value of the Qini curve at $0.2$ tells us the expected gain from treating the top 20% (as ranked by the model) compared to treating 20% randomly.\n\nThe Qini curve allows us to visualise and explain how the effectiveness of the treatment allocation changes as we expand who gets treated. For an applied researcher, this is very useful. We do more than not that 'heterogeneity exists.'  We are able to advise whether, 'if we have a budget to treat X% of people, here's what outcome we can expect.' For example, suppose an education intervention has an average effect of 5 test score points. The Qini analysis might show that focusing on the top 50% of the population (maybe those with certain demographic profiles) could yield an average effect of .15 SD units for those expected to benefit, meaning we would save resources on those unlikely to gain. At 100% (treating everyone), we're back to average treatment effect, which in this example is about half this amount (0.07 SD units). So the policy insight is: if only 50% can be afforded, target that group to maximise impact.\n\nTo summarise, Qini curves allow us to identify and communicate the value of targeted policies at specific coverage levels. They show whether the benefit of the treatment is concentrated in a small segment of the population or more widely distributed. When making policy recommendations, one could use the Qini curve to decide, for instance, 'we should implement the program for the top 50% most likely to benefit; beyond 50%, the returns diminish to roughly the average effect, so including more people isn’t cost-effective.' This level of analysis goes beyond saying 'there is heterogeneity'; instead, we quantifies *how much improvement* is possible and for what percentage of a target population.\n\n### Step 9 Avoiding over-fitting in policy evaluation (sample splitting for RATE/Qini)\n\nAn important statistical caution: when we use the same data to both train a model (such the causal forest) and evaluate its performance (like computing how well targeting does), we can get overly optimistic results. Even though the causal forest provides OOB estimates that are ostensibly out-of-sample for each individual, there is still a subtle form of overfitting possible if we are not careful. The forest was constructed to maximise heterogeneity in the training data, so using those same estimates to evaluate the policy can bias the evaluation upward (we might overstate the value of targeting because we are implicitly reusing the data).\n\nTo ensure valid inference, the best practice is to use explicit sample splitting or cross-fitting for the evaluation stage. This means, for example, after training the causal forest on the whole dataset (or a portion of it), we assess the RATE or Qini metrics on a fresh hold-out set that was not used in training. Here we use a separate hold-out set in which we train {{traning_proportion}} of the data, and use the unseen remainder as the validation set.\n\nWhy do we do this? Even though the forest’s OOB predictions are not directly from a model that saw that observation's outcome, there remains correlation – each observation’s prediction is an average from many trees, and while any given tree didn't see that observation, it saw many others including some that are also used in evaluating the policy. There is also the fact that OOB predictions are a form of cross-validation but not a true independent test, especially since the forest structure was influenced by all data. To be rigorous, researchers often do a double sample split: one split to train the forest, and a second split (completely independent) to compute the policy metrics like Qini or evaluate a specific targeting rule. This double-splitting ensures that when we say 'targeting the top 20% yields X improvement,' that claim is verified on data that played no part in determining who was top 20%. Thus, our inference (confidence intervals, p-values for heterogeneity) remains valid and not overly optimistic.\n\nIn plain terms, our workflow is as follows:\n\n1. Split the data into two parts: A and B.\n2. Use part A to train the causal forest and get $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$.\n3. Use part B to evaluate heterogeneity: apply the targeting rule in B, compute observed gains, and estimate RATE/Qini metrics on that held-out data.\n\nBy doing this, when we report 'p = 0.01 for heterogeneity' or 'Qini = 0.10 at 20% spending', we know these numbers are honest assessments of how the model would perform on new data, not just the data we fit it to.\n\nEven with OOB estimates, further sample splitting guards against optimistic bias.  This extra step is crucial for rigour: it prevents us from convincing ourselves that a complicated model is useful when in fact it might be explaining noise.\n\n### Step 10: Translating Insights into a Policy Tree\n\nCausal forests, while powerful, are 'black box' in nature – they may involve hundreds of trees and intricate splits that are not easy to interpret. For practical decision-making (especially in policy contexts), stakeholders often prefer a simple rule (for example, a checklist or a flowchart) that determines treatment eligibility. This is where policy trees come in. We addresse the *operational* question: given a budget and evidence of heterogeneity, which covariate splits deliver the largest welfare gain in a form stakeholders can audit?  Rather than picking out a familiar category grouping such as gender or ethnicity, policy trees reveal how effect variation aligns with resource availability.\n\nA policy tree is essentially a simple decision tree that assigns treatment or control based on a few covariates splits, optimised to yield good outcomes. The idea is to summarise the individual treatment effects $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ (or directly use the data) into a set of if-then rules that approximate the optimal targeting. For instance, a policy tree might look like: 'If age < 25 and baseline severity is high, give treatment; if age ≥ 25 and baseline severity is low, do not treat,' etc. These rules are much easier to communicate than a black-box forest.\n\n`grf` integrates with the `policytree` package to derive an optimal decision tree given the causal forest's estimates [@policytree_package_2024]. We feed either $\\hat\\tau(x)$ or doubly-robust scores into `policytree::policy_tree()`, which searches for splits that maximise expected welfare subject to a depth constraint.  The result is a shallow tree (often depth 1–2) that is far easier to communicate than the full forest.\n\n\n**Why use policy trees?** Apart from interpretability, policy trees can enforce fairness or simplicity constraints and avoid overfitting by limiting complexity. A shallow tree might capture the broad strokes of heterogeneity (e.g., young vs old, or high risk vs low risk) in a way that practitioners can double-check with domain knowledge. As an example from `grf` documentation:\n\n> Deciding who to assign the program based on a complicated black-box CATE function may be undesirable if policymakers want transparent criteria. Likewise, it may be problematic for participants to learn they were denied a beneficial program solely because a black-box algorithm predicted low benefit. In such settings, we want an interpretable policy, for example, a shallow decision tree that says ‘Alice is assigned treatment because she is under 25 and lives in a disadvantaged neighborhood' see: [https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html).\n\nThis nicely illustrates how a policy tree can provide a rationale in human terms.\n\n+**Training and validation for policy trees:** As when **constructing** causal forests and evaluating heterogeneity with RATE/Qini, we must avoid over-fitting. It is tempting to use the same data that suggested heterogeneity to also choose the best splits for the policy tree, but that can lead to optimistic results. The optimal tree is chosen to fit the training data well – if we do not validate it, we might pick a tree that works by chance quirks of the data. Therefore, we use cross-validation to select the tree's complexity (depth) and sample splitting to evaluate its performance, using {{train_proportion_decision_tree}} to train the tree and the remainder to valid it.\n\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\n#| label: fig-example-decision-tree\n#| fig-cap: \"Example Decision Tree.\"\n#| eval: true\n#| include: true\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 14\nmodels_binary_batch_example$model_t2_agreeableness_z$combined_plot\n```\n\n**Example**: Recall, @fig-example-qini shows reliable treatment heterogeneity for the effect of religious service attendance on agreeableness. @fig-example-decision-tree presents a policy tree analysis in which simple treatment rules are evaluated indicating who we should 'treat' with religious service if we hope to optimise agreeableness. Here we find that three variables predict treatment benefits: weekly hours commuting, weekly hours doing housework, and household income.  Specifically:\n\n- Participants who commute less than about 5.8 hours per week and have a household income above NZD 28,600 experience greater gains in agreeableness when attending religious services. However among those with very low income and lower commuting demands we would not expect added gains for agreeableness from religious service attendance.\n- Meanwhile, those with comparable higher commuting hours who household working hours are less than 16 hours per week are not expected to benefit in Agreeableness. However, those who are heavier commuters but and also doing more housework are expected to gain in agreeableness.\n\nThis analysis holds both theoretical and practical interest. Rather than picking out a familiar category grouping such as gender or ethnicity, policy trees reveal that effect vary by resource availability.\n\nOverall, policy trees condense the insights from causal forests into actionable guidelines.+We emphasise that deriving these guidelines includes rigorous validation: one part of the data learns the policy, another tests it. This ensures that the simple rules we recommend (e.g. 'treat those with lower time demands; do not treat incomes at a certain level') are supported by evidence rather than being artifacts of noise.\n\nAlthough estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and deriving actionable policy rules can be both theoretically and practically important, two considerations should temper our enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, the factors highlighted in policy trees are predictors of treatment-effect variability, but these predictors do not themselves have a causal interpretation. Returning to the example above, we should not infer that intervening to set someone’s travel and housework times to different values would change the variability in response. To understand the causal effects of joint interventions, we would need a different analysis. Decision trees are important because they draw attention to segments of a population likely to benefit, but they do not clarify the effects of changing a population structure.\n\nSecond, decisions about prioritising treatment rules are often ethical and political. Even if we set aside uncertainties in the modelling process, few would argue that fairness and justice should be determined by optimisation rules alone.. Even if we set aside uncertainties in the modelling process, few would argue that fairness and justice should be determined by optimisation rules alone. Such questions are typically resolved through democratic processes that involve stakeholder consultations, reflection on social values, a reckoning with historical inequities, and considerations beyond the scope of statistical analyses.",

Because we analyse several outcomes, we adjust ATE *p*-values with {{ate_adjustment}} ($\\alpha$ = {{ate_alpha}}) to control the family-wise error rate.\n\n\n\n\n### 2 Do Effects Vary?  Formal Test of Heterogeneity\n\nDefine the conditional average treatment effect (CATE)\n\n$$\n  \\tau(x)=E[Y(1)-Y(0)\\mid X=x].\n$$\n\nIf $\\tau(x)$ is constant, effects are homogeneous; otherwise they vary. Classical interaction models impose strong forms; **grf** uses *causal forests* to discover complex, nonlinear heterogeneity [@wager2018].  We assess heterogeneity with RATE *p*-values corrected via {{cate_adjustment}} (q = {{cate_alpha}}), controlling the false-discovery rate [@benjamini1995controlling].\n\n\n\n\n### 3 Causal Forests for Individualised Estimates\n\nA causal forest is an ensemble of 'honest' causal trees that split on covariates to maximise treated–control contrasts. For each unit $i$ we obtain\n\n$$\n  \\widehat{\\tau}(x_i)\n$$\n\nStrengths are flexibility, orthogonalisation, and per-person estimates.\n\n\n### 4 Built-in Protection Against Over-fitting\n\n  Honesty (split half/estimate half) plus out-of-bag (OOB) predictions yield unbiased $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$ and standard errors without manual hyper-tuning.\n\n\n### 5 Missing Data Handling\n\n**grf** deploys 'Missing Incorporated in Attributes' (MIA): missingness is a valid split, so cases stay in the analysis -- no ad-hoc imputation required.\n\n\n### 6 Testing for **Actionable** Heterogeneity: the TOC & RATE Metrics\n\nRanking units by $\\widehat{\\tau}$ defines a **Targeting Operator Characteristic** (TOC) curve: the cumulative gain from treating the top fraction $q$ of predicted responders. Two scalar summaries:\n\n- **RATE AUTOC** – area under the entire TOC; emphasises the very highest responders.\n- **RATE Qini** – weighted area with weight $q$; rewards sustained gains across larger coverage [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nUnder $H_0{:}\\tau(x)$ constant, both equal 0.\n`grf::rank_average_treatment_effect()` supplies point estimates, standard errors, and $t$-tests.\n\n**Multiplicity control**: We adjust AUTOC and Qini *p*-values with {{cate_adjustment}} (q = {{cate_alpha}}) before declaring actionable heterogeneity.\n\nHere is an **interpretation tip**:\n\n* AUTOC answers *'How sharply can we prioritise?'*\n* Qini answers *'How valuable is targeting when budgets are modest but not tiny?'*\n\n### 7 Visualising Policy Value: the Qini Curve\n\nPlotting the Qini curve (cumulative gain vs $q$) reveals where returns plateau. Investigators (and policy audiences) can see at a glance whether benefits concentrate in, say, the top 20 % or persist up to 50 %.\n\n\n### 8 Valid Inference for RATE / Qini\n\nAlthough OOB predictions are out-of-sample per tree, they inherit forest-level dependence. We use an explicit **sample split**:\n\n1. **Train set**: fit the causal forest and compute $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$.\n2. **Test set**: compute RATE AUTOC/Qini and run $H_0$ tests.\n\nThis second split yields honest policy evaluation and guards against optimistic bias [@grf2024].\n\n### 9 From Black Box to Simple Rules: Policy Trees\n\nStakeholders value transparent criteria. The **policytree** algorithm takes $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$ or doubly-robust scores and learns a shallow decision tree that maximises expected welfare [@policytree_package_2024].\n\n*Advantages*: interpretability, the possibility of fairness constraints, and easy communication (e.g., *'treat if age < 25 and baseline severity high'*).\n\nTraining mirrors the split above: learn the tree on one fold, evaluate welfare on another.\n\n> **Caveat**  Splits identify predictors of *effect variation*, not causal levers. Changing a covariate in the tree does **not** guarantee an effect on $\\tau(x)$.\n\n\n### 10 Ethical and Practical Considerations\n\nStatistical optimisation rarely aligns perfectly with equity or political feasibility. Decisions about who *should* receive treatment belong to democratic processes that weigh fairness, cost, and broader social values.\n\n\n### Putting it together\n\nThe sequence—ATE, causal-forest CATEs, RATE/Qini diagnostics, Qini curve, and finally a shallow policy tree—delivers both rigorous evidence and a defensible targeting rule.  Researchers learn **how large** heterogeneity is, **where** targeting pays off under budget constraints, and **which** simple covariate splits capture most of the welfare gain, all while guarding against over-fitting and multiplicity.\n"
