Data were from a survey of a large and representative sample of Scottish teenagers administered in the late 1980s. The {SIRD} model distinguishes effects of group-based and personal relative deprivation, which should be independent of one another. Importantly, social change beliefs should mediate the effects of both collective relative deprivation and group identification on protest intentions (in this case intention to vote for the {SNP}). Egoistic relative deprivation should be the strongest predictor of feelings of depression. Using structural equation modelling, the results strongly support this model and replicate in two different cohorts.},

	abstract = {Trait forgivingness is the disposition to forgive interpersonal transgressions over time and across situations. We define forgiveness as the replacement of negative unforgiving emotions with positive, other-oriented emotions. Rumination has been suggested as a mediator between forgivingness and emotional outcomes; however, we suggest that different content of rumination leads to different outcomes after transgressions. In four studies of 179, 233, 80, and 66 undergraduate students, trait forgivingness was negatively correlated with trait anger, hostility, neuroticism, fear, and vengeful rumination and was positively correlated with agreeableness, extraversion, and trait empathy. The disposition to ruminate vengefully mediated the relationship between trait forgivingness and (1) anger-related traits and (2) both revenge motivations and state anger following a specific recent transgression, but it did not mediate between forgivingness and (1) fearfulness and (2) avoidance motivations following a specific transgression. Self-hate statements, a proxy for depressive rumination, mediated the relationship between forgivingness and both depression and fearfulness but not the relationship between forgivingness and trait anger. Future research should distinguish the contents of mental rumination following interpersonal transgressions.},

	shorttitle = {The Pittsburgh sleep quality index},
	abstract = {Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ({PSQI}) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven “component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the {PSQI} were assessed over an 18-month period with “good” sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and “poor” sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global {PSQI} score {\textgreater} 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6\% and specificity of 86.5\% (kappa = 0.75, p ⩽ 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinemetric and clinical properties of the {PSQI} suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},

Open-ended measures afford the greatest flexibility, though whether they are practical for large-scale surveys has yet to be tested. Here, we systematically assess the feasibility of open-ended gender measures drawing on a New Zealand national probability sample (New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, N = 15,758). We asked participants “What is your gender?” as an open-ended measure of gender, and developed a simple, cost-effective coding scheme for coding qualitative gender data. Results indicate that very few participants (n = 15) self-identified as transgender, or outside of the male/female gender binary. Moreover, we find no evidence that implementation of the open-ended measure contributes to non-response rates or panel attrition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that large-scale surveys can feasibly implement inclusive measures of gender as an alternative to binary categorical measures. Because the single-measure approach likely underestimates the number of transgender participants, however, researchers interested in identifying all participants whose gender differs from their assigned sex should utilize two-step methods, which assess gender as well as assigned sex at birth.},

As predicted, our analyses indicated that self-reported appearance as Māori, or the extent to which people thought they personally displayed features which visibly identified them as Māori to others, significantly predicted decreased rates of home ownership. This association held when adjusting for numerous demographic covariates, such as education, level of deprivation of the immediate area, household income, age, relationship status, region of residence, and so forth.

The end-of-ideologists were so influential that researchers ignored the topic of ideology for many years. However, current political realities, recent data from the American National Election Studies, and results from an emerging psychological paradigm provide strong grounds for returning to the study of ideology. Studies reveal that there are indeed meaningful political and psychological differences that covary with ideological self-placement. Situational variables--including system threat and mortality salience--and dispositional variables--including openness and conscientiousness--affect the degree to which an individual is drawn to liberal versus conservative leaders, parties, and opinions. A psychological analysis is also useful for understanding the political divide between "red states" and "blue states." ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Central to the analysis is the question of how members deal with intergroup difference. If the outgroup's difference is judged to be non-normative and inferior, devaluation, discrimination, and hostility are likely responses toward the outgroup. Judging the outgroup's difference to be normative or positive leads to acceptance and appreciation of this group. Following self-categorization theory, the criteria being norms and values for judging intergroup differences are derived from the superordinate category that is perceived to include both groups. More specifically, they are derived from the prototype, or representation, of this inclusive category. Social discrimination results from the generalization of ingroup attributes to the inclusive category, which then become criteria for judging the outgroup. Tolerance, on the other hand, is conceptualized as either a lack of inclusion of both groups in a higher order category or as the representation of the inclusive category in such a way as to also include the other group and designate it as normative.},

{DESIGN}: We investigate links between subjective elements of Māori identity, demographic factors and perceived discrimination with smoking status in a national probability sample of self-identified Māori (N = 667).
{RESULTS}: Our results suggest that core aspects of Māori identity and cultural engagement were not significantly linked with smoking. However, the extent to which participants felt they were perceived as prototypically Māori (measured as Perceived Appearance) was reliably associated with smoking. The effect of Perceived Appearance held when adjusting for perceived experiences of discrimination and other standard demographic indicators.
{CONCLUSION}: Our analysis indicates that simply feeling that one is more visibly Māori is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking. This may reflect how Māori negotiate the larger systemic forces of racism present in New Zealand society.},

To address the broader issue of single-item measure reliability, a meta-analysis of 16 widely used single-item measures is reported. The reliability of single-item scales ranges from low to reasonably high. Compared with this field, reliability of the {SISI} is high. In general, short measures struggle to achieve acceptable reliability because the constructs they assess are broad and heterogeneous.

In Study 1, after testing the internal structure of the measure (N = 749), a subset of the current {APS}–R items was derived (Short Almost Perfect Scale [{SAPS}]) that possessed good psychometric features, such as strong item–factor loadings, score reliability, measurement invariance between women and men, and criterion-related validity through associations with neuroticism, conscientiousness, academic performance, and depression. Controlling for neuroticism and conscientiousness, factor mixture modeling supported a 2-factor, 3-class model of perfectionism, and results were consistent with labeling the classes as nonperfectionists and adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists. Measurement results were cross-validated in a separate sample (N = 335). Study 2 also provided substantial evidence for the convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity of {SAPS} scores.

	abstract = {Growing media consumption and emerging forms of social media such as Facebook allow for unprecedented appearance-based social comparison with peers, family, and the wider media. We hypothesise that, for adult men and women, body dissatisfaction is related to peer-based media just as it is to traditional media forms. We expect that middle-aged women in particular are a vulnerable population, due to increasing pressure to conform to youthful beauty standards. In a national sample of New Zealand adults collected in 2012 (N = 11,017), we test the cross-sectional links between being a Facebook user and body satisfaction for men and women across age cohorts. Using a Bayesian regression model testing curvilinear effects of age, we show that having and using a Facebook profile is associated with poorer body satisfaction for both men and women, and across all ages. For women who use Facebook, a U-shaped curvilinear relationship was found between age and body satisfaction; thus the gap between non-users and users in body satisfaction was exacerbated among middle-aged women. A possible cohort effect also indicated that young women tend to be lower in body satisfaction overall. These findings add to the extant literature by suggesting that new media exposure may be associated with lower body satisfaction for some populations more than others, and emphasise the importance of examining body satisfaction in older populations.

The new scale showed good internal consistency and retest reliability. Higher scores on self-control correlated with a higher grade point average, better adjustment (fewer reports of psychopathology, higher self-esteem), less binge eating and alcohol abuse, better relationships and interpersonal skills, secure attachment, and more optimal emotional responses. Tests for curvilinearity failed to indicate any drawbacks of so-called overcontrol, and the positive effects remained after controlling for social desirability. Low self-control is thus a significant risk factor for a broad range of personal and interpersonal problems.},

	abstract = {Procedural justice research has documented many positive consequences of fair decision-making procedures and treatment by authorities. However, it is unclear why these effects of procedural justice occur. The group-value model proposes that fair procedures matter because they communicate two symbolic messages about group membership: (1) whether individuals are respected members of a group and (2) whether they should feel pride in the group as a whole. These messages are conveyed by 3 relational aspects of the actions of authorities: actions that indicate neutrality, trustworthiness, and status recognition. Results from 4 different studies provide evidence that (1) relational aspects of fair procedures communicate group-relevant information and (2) this information mediates the influence of procedural judgments on group-oriented behaviors and feelings of self-esteem.

In Study 1, 1,486 participants from 62 countries accessed the authors' on-line experiment on the Internet. They were asked to use mental visualization while playing a virtual tossing game with two others (who were actually computer generated and controlled). Despite the minimal nature of their experience, the more participants were ostracized, the more they reported feeling bad, having less control, and losing a sense of belonging. In Study 2, ostracized participants were more likely to conform on a subsequent task. The results are discussed in terms of supporting K. D. Williams's (1997) need threat theory of ostracism.

	abstract = {We report data from a large national sample to explore four research questions regarding religious denominations and groups in New Zealand in 2009 (N = 6,086). These include (a) the demographic characteristics of religious denominations and groups, (b) how strongly people psychologically identify with their religious group, (c) support for two politicised social issues (the anti-smacking law and Civil Union Act), and (d) differences in income and the proportion donated to charity. Our results show considerable variation in the demographic characteristics of different religious groups in New Zealand; with Anglicans and Presbyterians being amongst the oldest groups on average, and Mormons and Evangelical Christian groups being amongst the youngest. There was also substantial variation across denominations and groups in the psychological strength of religious identification. Consistent with results of the 2009 smacking referendum, most Christians and most non-religious people felt that smacking children as part of good parental correction should not be considered a criminal offence in New Zealand. Christians were generally more opposed to The Civil Union Act, although opinions about this issue differed substantially across denominations. Finally, Christians gave an average of {NZ}\$995 (3.8\% of pre-tax income) to charity in 2009, whereas non-religious people gave an average of {NZ}\$284 (0.9\% of pre-tax income). Proportional charitable donation varied considerably across denominations, ranging from 1.0\% to 12.7\%. On average, religious groups that tended to earn the least gave proportionately more of their personal income to charity.},

    abstract = "{Mediation analysis is appealing for its ability to improve understanding of the mechanistic drivers of causal effects, but real-world data complexities challenge its successful implementation, including (i) the existence of post-exposure variables that also affect mediators and outcomes (thus, confounding the mediator-outcome relationship), that may also be (ii) multivariate, and (iii) the existence of multivariate mediators. All three challenges are present in the mediation analysis we consider here, where our goal is to estimate the indirect effects of receiving a Section 8 housing voucher as a young child on the risk of developing a psychiatric mood disorder in adolescence that operate through mediators related to neighborhood poverty, the school environment, and instability of the neighborhood and school environments, considered together and separately. Interventional direct and indirect effects (IDE/IIE) accommodate post-exposure variables that confound the mediator–outcome relationship, but currently, no readily implementable nonparametric estimator for IDE/IIE exists that allows for both multivariate mediators and multivariate post-exposure intermediate confounders. The absence of such an IDE/IIE estimator that can easily accommodate both multivariate mediators and post-exposure confounders represents a significant limitation for real-world analyses, because when considering each mediator subgroup separately, the remaining mediator subgroups (or a subset of them) become post-exposure intermediate confounders. We address this gap by extending a recently developed nonparametric estimator for the IDE/IIE to allow for easy incorporation of multivariate mediators and multivariate post-exposure confounders simultaneously. We apply the proposed estimation approach to our analysis, including walking through a strategy to account for other, possibly co-occurring intermediate variables when considering each mediator subgroup separately.}",

    abstract = "{Studies on the association between attendance at religious services and mortality often have been limited by inadequate methods for reverse causation, inability to assess effects over time, and limited information on mediators and cause-specific mortality.To evaluate associations between attendance at religious services and subsequent mortality in women.Attendance at religious services was assessed from the first questionnaire in 1992 through June 2012, by a self-reported question asked of 74, 534 women in the Nurses’ Health Study who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline. Data analysis was conducted from return of the 1996 questionnaire through June 2012.Cox proportional hazards regression model and marginal structural models with time-varying covariates were used to examine the association of attendance at religious services with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We adjusted for a wide range of demographic covariates, lifestyle factors, and medical history measured repeatedly during the follow-up, and performed sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of potential unmeasured and residual confounding.Among the 74 534 women participants, there were 13, 537 deaths, including 2721 owing to cardiovascular deaths and 4479 owing to cancer deaths. After multivariable adjustment for major lifestyle factors, risk factors, and attendance at religious services in 1992, attending a religious service more than once per week was associated with 33\\% lower all-cause mortality compared with women who had never attended religious services (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95\\% CI, 0.62-0.71; P \\&lt; .001 for trend). Comparing women who attended religious services more than once per week with those who never attend, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 0.73 (95\\% CI, 0.62-0.85; P \\&lt; .001 for trend) and for cancer mortality was 0.79 (95\\% CI, 0.70-0.89; P\\&lt;.001 for trend). Results were robust in sensitivity analysis. Depressive symptoms, smoking, social support, and optimism were potentially important mediators, although the overall proportion of the association between attendance at religious services and mortality was moderate (eg, social support explained 23\\% of the effect [P = .003], depressive symptoms explained 11\\% [P \\&lt; .001], smoking explained 22\\% [P \\&lt; .001], and optimism explained 9\\% [P \\&lt; .001]).Frequent attendance at religious services was associated with significantly lower risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality among women. Religion and spirituality may be an underappreciated resource that physicians could explore with their patients, as appropriate.}",

abstract = {In many areas, practitioners seek to use observational data to learn a treatment assignment policy that satisfies application-specific constraints, such as budget, fairness, simplicity, or other functional form constraints. For example, policies may be restricted to take the form of decision trees based on a limited set of easily observable individual characteristics. We propose a new approach to this problem motivated by the theory of semiparametrically efficient estimation. Our method can be used to optimize either binary treatments or infinitesimal nudges to continuous treatments, and can leverage observational data where causal effects are identified using a variety of strategies, including selection on observables and instrumental variables. Given a doubly robust estimator of the causal effect of assigning everyone to treatment, we develop an algorithm for choosing whom to treat, and establish strong guarantees for the asymptotic utilitarian regret of the resulting policy.},

 abstract = {Ordinal models can be seen as being composed from simpler, in particular binary models. This view on ordinal models allows to derive a taxonomy of models that includes basic ordinal regression models, models with more complex parameterizations, the class of hierarchically structured models, and the more recently developed finite mixture models. The structured overview that is given covers existing models and shows how models can be extended to account for further effects of explanatory variables. Particular attention is given to the modeling of additional heterogeneity as, for example, dispersion effects. The modeling is embedded into the framework of response styles and the exact meaning of heterogeneity terms in ordinal models is investigated. It is shown that the meaning of terms is crucially determined by the type of model that is used. Moreover, it is demonstrated how models with a complex category-specific effect structure can be simplified to obtain simpler models that fit sufficiently well. The fitting of models is illustrated by use of a real data set, and a short overview of existing software is given.},

    abstract = {Flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects lies at the heart of many statistical applications, such as personalized medicine and optimal resource allocation. In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

Such adaptivity introduces complex correlations between the data and the collection procedure. In this paper, we prove that when the data collection procedure satisfies natural conditions, then sample means of the data have systematic negative biases. As an example, consider an adaptive clinical trial where additional data points are more likely to be tested for treatments that show initial promise. Our surprising result implies that the average observed treatment effects would underestimate the true effects of each treatment. We quantitatively analyze the magnitude and behavior of this negative bias in a variety of settings. We also propose a novel debiasing algorithm based on selective inference techniques. In experiments, our method can effectively reduce bias and estimation error. }
