### Antagonism 

Antagonism affects partners and the self in different ways. For the **partner**, the only reliable result is a reduction in life satisfaction ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.17, -0.04]$).

For the **self**, antagonism reliably increases life satisfaction ($0.10$, 95% CI: $[0.04, 0.15]$), personal well-being ($0.13$, 95% CI: $[0.07, 0.19]$), satisfaction with the relationship ($0.11$, 95% CI: $[0.05, 0.17]$), and self-esteem ($0.08$, 95% CI: $[0.02, 0.13]$).

### Disinhibition

For the **partner**, none of the results are reliable as all confidence intervals cross zero.

For the **self**, disinhibition reliably reduces anxiety ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.15, -0.05]$) and distress ($-0.05$, 95% CI: $[-0.10, -0.01]$). There is also a marginally reliable improvement in personal well-being ($0.05$, 95% CI: $[0.00, 0.11]$) and self-esteem ($0.05$, 95% CI: $[0.00, 0.10]$).



### Emotional Stability

For the **partner**, none of the results are reliable as all confidence intervals cross zero.

For the **self**, emotional stability reliably reduces anxiety ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.15, -0.05]$) and distress ($-0.06$, 95% CI: $[-0.10, -0.01]$). There is also a marginally reliable improvement in personal well-being ($0.05$, 95% CI: $[0.00, 0.11]$) and self-esteem ($0.05$, 95% CI: $[0.01, 0.10]$).


### Narcicissm: 

For **partners**, narcissism reliably increases personal well-being ($0.07$, 95% CI: $[0.02, 0.12]$) and satisfaction with the relationship ($0.08$, 95% CI: $[0.01, 0.14]$). No other reliable effects are observed.

For the **self**, narcissism reliably reduces anxiety ($-0.08$, 95% CI: $[-0.14, -0.03]$), depression ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.16, -0.04]$), and distress ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.15, -0.04]$). It also reliably improves life satisfaction ($0.12$, 95% CI: $[0.06, 0.18]$) and self-esteem ($0.11$, 95% CI: $[0.06, 0.17]$).



### Psychopathy Combined 

For the **partner**, psychopathy reliably increases anxiety ($0.07$, 95% CI: $[0.03, 0.11]$) and distress ($0.05$, 95% CI: $[0.01, 0.09]$). It also reliably decreases personal well-being ($-0.11$, 95% CI: $[-0.14, -0.07]$), satisfaction with the relationship ($-0.06$, 95% CI: $[-0.10, -0.03]$), and self-esteem ($-0.09$, 95% CI: $[-0.13, -0.06]$).

For the **self**, psychopathy reliably reduces anxiety ($-0.08$, 95% CI: $[-0.14, -0.03]$), depression ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.16, -0.04]$), and distress ($-0.10$, 95% CI: $[-0.15, -0.04]$). It also reliably improves life satisfaction ($0.12$, 95% CI: $[0.06, 0.18]$) and self-esteem ($0.11$, 95% CI: $[0.06, 0.17]$).

In summary, psychopathy reliably increases anxiety and distress for the partner while decreasing their personal well-being, relationship satisfaction, and self-esteem. For the self, it reduces anxiety, depression, and distress, and improves life satisfaction and self-esteem.


### Importance of Research

These findings reveal that focussing on specific traits of psychopathic personality affects people differently than does psychopathy as a whole. When we target individual traits like antagonism or narcissism, individuals often feel better about themselvesâ€”they report higher life satisfaction, well-being, and self-esteem. However, such improvements for the individual can come at a cost to their partners, who may experience decreased life satisfaction and increased distress.

On the other hand, when psychopathy is treated as a single, combined dimension, partners tend to suffer more. They experience more anxiety and distress, along with lower personal well-being and satisfaction in the relationship. 





These findings reveal that adjusting specific traits of psychopathic personality affects individuals and their partners differently than adjusting psychopathy, a composite of such traits. When we target individual traits such as antagonism or narcissism, people often feel better about themselves -- they report higher life satisfaction, well-being, and self-esteem, and experience reduced depression and anxiety. However, these personal improvements can come at a cost to their partners, who may suffer from decreased life satisfaction and increased distress. This indicates a complex interplay between self-improvement and relational harm.

On the other hand, when psychopathy is treated as a single, combined dimension, partners tend to suffer more. They experience more anxiety and distress, along with lower personal well-being and satisfaction in the relationship. Although, individuals for whom psychopathy increases might feel less depressed, they do not experience an overall improvement in well-being. As for partners, self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, and personal well being declines.  Moreover, life satisifaction declines and anxiety increases.
