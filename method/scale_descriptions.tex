Kessler et al., 2002), which exhibits strong diagnostic concordance for
moderate and severe psychological distress in large, cross-cultural
samples (R. C. Kessler et al., 2010; Prochaska et al., 2012).

data such as income, home ownership, employment, qualifications, family
structure, housing, and access to transport and communication for an
area into one deprivation score.

\hypertarget{national-well-being-index}{%
\paragraph{National Well-being Index}\label{national-well-being-index}}

satisfied with my performance. Participants indicated the extent to
which they agree with these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly
Agree).

\hypertarget{political-orientation}{%
\paragraph{Political Orientation}\label{political-orientation}}

We measured participants' political orientation using a single item

politically left-wing versus right-wing they see themselves as being (1
= Extremely Left-wing to 7 = Extremely Right-wing)

\hypertarget{power-dependence}{%
\paragraph{Power Dependence}\label{power-dependence}}

life. Participants indicated their agreement with these items (1 =
Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree).

\hypertarget{religion-idenfication}{%
\paragraph{Religion Idenfication}\label{religion-idenfication}}

Participants were asked to indicate their religion identification (``Do
you identify with a religion and/or spiritual group?'') on a binary
response (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

\hypertarget{self-respect}{%
\paragraph{Self-Respect}\label{self-respect}}

We assessed participants' levels of self-respect using an item adapted
from Tyler et al. (1996). Participant indicated the extent to which they
agree with the statement (``If they knew me, most NZers would respect
what I have accomplished in life'') on a likert scale (1 = Strongly
Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree)

\hypertarget{retired}{%
\paragraph{Retired}\label{retired}}

Participants were asked to indicate whether they were retiered or not in
the last year (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

\hypertarget{rumination}{%
\paragraph{Rumination}\label{rumination}}

We used a single item adapted from Nolen-hoeksema \& Morrow (1993) to
measure participants' level of rumination. Participants were asked,
``During the last 30 days, how often did\ldots you have negative
thoughts that repeated over and over?'' and indicated their frequency of
rumination on an ordinal scale (0 = None of The time, 1 = A little of
the time, 2 = some of the time, 3 = most of the time, 4 = all of the
time)

\hypertarget{self-control}{%
\paragraph{Self-Control}\label{self-control}}

Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they endorse the
two items (``In general, I have a lot of self-control'', ``I wish I had
more self-discipline'') from Tangney et al. (2004). The responses to the
items ranged from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).

\hypertarget{self-esteem}{%
\paragraph{Self-Esteem}\label{self-esteem}}

We measured participants' self-esteem using three items adapted from
Rosenberg (1965). Participants were instructed to circle the number that
best represents how accurately each statement describes them.
Participants responded to the items (``On the whole am satisfied with
myself.'', ``Take a positive attitude toward myself'', ``Am inclined to
feel that I am a failure'') on a likert-type scale (1 = Very inaccurate

straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.)''.

\hypertarget{sexual-satisfaction}{%
\paragraph{Sexual Satisfaction}\label{sexual-satisfaction}}

Participants were asked ``How satisfied are you with your sex life?'' (1
= Not satisfied to 7 = Very satisfied).

\hypertarget{short-form-health}{%
\paragraph{Short-Form Health}\label{short-form-health}}

Participants' subjective health was measured using one item (``Do you
have a health condition or disability that limits you, and that has
lasted for 6+ months?''; 1 = Yes, 0 = No) adapted from Verbrugge (1997).

\hypertarget{smoker}{%
\paragraph{Smoker}\label{smoker}}

We asked participants whether they are currently smoking or not (1 = Yes
or 0 = No), using a single item (``Do you currently smoke?) from Muriwai
et al. (2018).

\hypertarget{spiritual-identification}{%
\paragraph{Spiritual Identification}\label{spiritual-identification}}

Spiritual identification was measured using one item (``I identify as a
spiritual person.'') from Postmes et al. (2013). Participants indicated
their agreement with this item (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly
Agree).

\hypertarget{standard-living}{%
\paragraph{Standard Living}\label{standard-living}}

We measured participants' satisfaction with their standard of living
using an item from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index (Cummins et al.,
2003). Participants read an instruction (``Please rate your level of
satisfaction with the following aspects of your life and New Zealand.'')
and responded to an item (``Your standard of living'') on a 10-point
scale (0 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied).

\hypertarget{support}{%
\paragraph{Support}\label{support}}

Participants' perceived social support was measured using three items
from Cutrona \& Russell (1987) and Williams et al. (2000): (1) ``There
are people I can depend on to help me if I really need it''; (2) ``There
is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of stress''; (3) ``I know
there are people I can turn to when I need help.'' Participants
indicated the extent to which they agree with those items (1 = Strongly
Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). The second item was negatively-worded,
so we reversely recorded the responses to this item.

\paragraph{Vengeful Rumination}\label{vengeful-rumination}}

We assessed participants' vengeful rumination using three items,
respectively adapted from Caprara (1986) and Berry et al. (2005), and
developed for NZAVS: (1) Sometimes I can't sleep because of thinking
about past wrongs I have suffered; (2) I can usually forgive and forget
when someone does me wrong; (3) I find myself regularly thinking about
past times that I have been wronged. Participants indicated their
agreeement with these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly
Agree). The values for the sencond item were reversely coded.

\hypertarget{volunteers}{%
\paragraph{Volunteers}\label{volunteers}}

Participants were asked,``Please estimate how many hours you spent doing
each of the following things last week'' and responded to an item
(``voluntary/charitable work''), from (C. G. Sibley et al., 2011).

\hypertarget{subjective-wellbeing}{%
\paragraph{Subjective Wellbeing}\label{subjective-wellbeing}}

We measured participants' subjective wellbeing using three items from
the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index (Cummins et al., 2003): (1) your
health; (2) your future security; (3) your future security. Participants
read an instruction (``The following items assess your current
satisfaction with different aspects of your life and aspects of New
Zealand more generally'') and indicated their satisfaction with those
items (0 = Completely Dissatisfied to 10 = Completely Satisfied).

\hypertarget{feeling-thermometer}{%
\paragraph{Feeling Thermometer}\label{feeling-thermometer}}

Warmth toward groups was rated by a one-item measure using the ``feeling
thermometer'' scale. Participants were asked to rate their feeling of
warmth toward the following groups: NZ European, Māori, Asians in
general, Pacific Islanders, Elderly people, People with a disability,
Overweight people, Immigrants in general, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, and
People with mental illness. Ratings were on a 7-point scale from (1 =
least warmth toward a group to 7 = most warmth toward a group, with 4
being neutral. In this study we use ``warmth'' and ``acceptance''
interchangeably. (Modelled on affect thermometer items in United States
National Election Study (C. G. Sibley et al., 2020).
