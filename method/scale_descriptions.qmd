The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study allows opt-ins to the study. Because the opt-in population may differ from those sampled randomly from the New Zealand electoral role; although the opt-in rate is low, we include an indicator (yes/no) for this variable.

#### Occupational Prestige and Status

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13) [@fahy2017a]. This index uses the income, age, and education of a reference group, in this case the 2013 New Zealand census, to calculate an score for each occupational group. Scores range from 10 (Lowest) to 90 (Highest). This list of index scores for occupational groups was used to assign each participant a NZSEI-13 score based on their occupation.

 - Do you have siblings?
 - How many older sisters do you have?
 - How many younger sisters do you have?
 - How many older brothers do you have?
 - How many younger brothers do you have?

A single score was obtained from sibling counts by summing responses to the "How many..." items. From these scores an ordered factor was created ranging from 0 to 7, where participants with more than 7 siblings were grouped into the highest category. 

#### Smoker

We asked participants whether they are currently smoking or not (1 = Yes or 0 = No), using a single item ("Do you currently smoke?) from @muriwai_looking_2018.

We measured participants' satisfaction with their standard of living using an item from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index [@cummins_developing_2003]. Participants read an instruction ("Please rate your level of satisfaction with the following aspects of your life and New Zealand.") and responded to an item ("Your standard of living") on a 10-point scale (0 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied).

Participants' perceived social support was measured using three items from @cutrona1987 and @williams_cyberostracism_2000: (1) "There are people I can depend on to help me if I really need it"; (2) "There is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of stress"; (3) "I know there are people I can turn to when I need help." Participants indicated the extent to which they agree with those items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). The second item was negatively-worded, so we reversely recorded the responses to this item.


#### Support received (times 10-13)

The NZAVS has a 'revealed' measure of received help and support measured in hours. The items are: 

Received help and support - hours
  - family
  - friends
  - others in my community

#### Living in an Urban Area

We coded whether they are living in an urban or rural area (1 = Urban, 0 = Rural) based on the addresses provided.

#### Vengeful Rumination

Participants read an instruction ("The following items assess your current satisfaction with different aspects of your life and aspects of New Zealand more generally") and indicated their satisfaction with those items (0 = Completely Dissatisfied to 10 = Completely Satisfied).

#### Feeling Thermometer (Warmth)

Warmth toward groups was rated by a one-item measure using the "feeling thermometer" scale. Participants were asked to rate their feeling of warmth toward the following groups: NZ European, Māori, Asians in general, Pacific Islanders, Elderly people, People with a disability, Overweight people, Immigrants in general, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, and People with mental illness. Ratings were on a 7-point scale from (1 = least warmth toward a group to 7 = most warmth toward a group, with 4 being neutral. This measure is modelled on affect thermometer items in United States National Election Study [@sibley2020].
