Sometimes, the effect of $A$ on $Y$ isn't the same for everyone; it might be stronger or weaker depending on other characteristics. This is called 'effect modification'. For effect modification to even be possible, the treatment must have some effect on at least some individuals [@bulbulia2024wierd].\n\nWe cannot simply look at average differences within our sample to understand how effects vary. Instead, we need to use statistical models to investigate this potential heterogeneity [@grf2024; @vansteelandt2022a]. Alternatively, we might want to compare if the treatment effect differs between specific groups in the population, such as different cultural groups or genders.\n\n::: {#tbl-terminologyeffectmodification}\n```{=latex}\n\\terminologyeffectmodification\nGraphical conventions used to represent effect modification.\n:::\n\n@tbl-terminologyeffectmodification shows the symbols we use in diagrams to discuss effect modification clearly. To focus purely on effect modification, we assume the treatment ($A$) was assigned randomly (like flipping a coin, $\\mathcal{R} \\rightarrow A$). This means we assume the basic relationship is $A$ causes $Y$ ($A \\to Y$), without other factors confusing this link.\n\nTherefore, we don't need complex causal diagrams to adjust for confounding of the treatment effect itself. We also won't draw a causal arrow from the variable that modifies the effect ($F$) directly to the outcome ($Y$). This choice helps us focus solely on how $F$ changes the $A \to Y$ relationship. (For discussion on different arrow types, see @hernan2024WHATIF, pp. 126-127).\n\n::: {#tbl-terminologyeffectmodificationtypes}\n\\terminologyeffectmodificationtypes\nExamples of Effect Modification Scenarios\n:::\n\nThe diagrams in @tbl-terminologyeffectmodificationtypes illustrate the central point: whether we find effect modification depends on which variables we include in our statistical analysis.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_1$, the variable $F$ directly influences how $A$ affects $Y$. The open arrow towards the $A \\to Y$ path indicates that $F$ is associated with differences in the effect, without necessarily claiming $F$ causes this difference.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_2$, $F$ is an unobserved factor that modifies the $A \to Y$ effect. If the distribution of $F$ differs between populations (e.g., a study population vs. a target population), the average treatment effect found in the study might not apply elsewhere. Generalising findings requires careful consideration [@hernan2024WHATIF; @bulbulia2024wierd]. Estimates can be misleading if the target population differs from the study population regarding effect-modifying characteristics [@greenland2009commentary; @lash2020; @bulbulia2024wierd].\n\nNow, consider the diagrams $\\mathcal{G}_3$ to $\\mathcal{G}_6$, which use the same underlying causal structure but different analysis choices. Let's use an example: $F$ is childhood deprivation, $G$ is educational achievement (influenced by $F$), $A$ is a government educational initiative, and $Y$ is recycling behaviour.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_3$, $F$ (deprivation) directly modifies the effect of the initiative ($A$) on recycling ($Y$). $G$ (education) is influenced by $F$. If our statistical analysis accounts for $F$, we essentially block the connection from $G$ to $Y$ that goes through $F$. In this analysis, we would not find that the initiative's effectiveness varies by education level ($G$).\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_4$, we use the same scenario but analyse the data without accounting for $F$ (deprivation), only including $G$ (education). Because the link between education ($G$), deprivation ($F$), and recycling ($Y$) ($G \\leftarrow F \\rightarrow Y$) is not blocked in this analysis, we would find that the initiative's effect ($A \\to Y$) varies by education level ($G$). Here, $G$ appears to be an effect modifier simply because of our analysis choice.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_5$, let's add another variable: $B$, representing depression (measured before $G$). Suppose $B$ also influences education ($G$). If we analyse the data including education ($G$) and depression ($B$), but not deprivation ($F$), something interesting happens. Because $G$ is influenced by both $F$ and $B$, including $G$ in the model creates an artificial statistical link between $B$ and $F$ (via $G$). This makes it look like the initiative's effect ($A \\to Y$) varies by depression level ($B$), even though $B$ has no actual causal link to $Y$ in this structure. The apparent effect modification by $B$ is an artefact of the analysis, not a reflection of causation.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{G}_6$, if we include the direct modifier $F$ (deprivation) in our analysis, it blocks the artificial pathways seen in $\\mathcal{G}_4$ and $\\mathcal{G}_5$. We would not find effect modification by education ($G$) or depression ($B$) in this case. This strongly highlights that our findings about effect modification depend on (1) the true underlying causal relationships and (2) which variables we choose to include in our statistical model.\n\nUsing principles from causal diagrams [@vanderweele2012], it becomes clear that analysing effect modification requires thinking about the assumed causal structure and explicitly stating which variables are included in the statistical model. Policymakers and researchers might reach wrong conclusions if they misinterpret effect modification findings without considering how the analysis was done [@bulbulia2024swigstime]. Remember, when we assess effect modification, we are asking if the treatment effect differs across groups, not whether the characteristics defining those groups themselves cause the outcome.

The correlation must not be spurious or due to a confounding factor.\n3. $X$ must precede $Y$ in time.\n\n\nThe modern causal inference literature, which has advanced considerably over the past two decades in fields such as epidemiology, computer science, economics, and policy research, has shown that these assumptions are inadequate. Consider the following limitations of the traditional veiw.\n\n\n### Condition 1: It is not true that causation implies correlation\n\n\nUsing Pearl’s graphical models, causality can be defined as $X \rightarrow Y$, where conditioning on a mediator is denoted by $\boxed{M}$. Pearl has shown that in the scenario $X \rightarrow \boxed{M} \rightarrow Y$, causality can exist without a direct association between $X$ and $Y$. This is crucial because, with only two waves of data, any variable measured at Wave 1 could act as a mediator, potentially obscuring the true association between $X$ at time 1 and $Y$ at time 2. To address mediator bias effectively, at least three waves of data are required to disentangle these causal pathways [@vanderweele2020].\n\n### Condition 2: The confounding criterion is insufficient to evaluate causality\n\n\nThis condition essentially restates the idea that an association must be causal to be valid, which, although trivially true, adds no meaningful insight.\n\nThe confounding criterion typically applies when treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ share a common cause, $L$. By adjusting for $L$, we aim to remove the confounding effect. However, consider a scenario where $X$ precedes $Y$ and both $X$ and $Y$ cause $L$, without a direct relationship between $X$ and $Y$. In Pearl's graphical terms, this would be represented as $X \\rightarrow \boxed{L} \\leftarrow Y$. Conditioning on $L$ would induce a spurious association between $X$ and $Y$ that would not exist without conditioning. This demonstrates even when we account for confounding by commong cause, the association between $X$ and $Y$ may be biased.\n\nMore fundamental, when including multiple varaibles in our models, we do not automatically obtain consistent causal effect estimates Take the simple case where $L \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y$, and suppose that $L \\rightarrow Y$.  To consistently estimate the a causal effect of $X \\rightarrow Y$ we must adjust for $\boxed{L}$.  If the causal relationships we have just described are correct, we may obtain valid causal inference for $X \\rightarrow Y$ by adjusting for $\\boxed{L}$. However the coefficient we obtain for $L$ in our stastical model will not consistently estimate the causal effect of $L \\to Y$ because $X$ is a mediator, such that  $L \\to \boxed{X} \to  Y$.\n\nInference become even more delicate when we add variables to our model because spurious correlations may be induced. For example, suppose that $L$ is no casually related to $Y$, but causally related to $X$. Suppose further that and unmesaured variable $U$ is related to both $X$ and $Y$ as a common cause.  In this case, there is unmeasured confounding for $X \\to Y$. However, conditioning on $X$ introduces bias for the path for $L$ to $Y$ because $\boxed{X}$ is a collider of $U$ and $L$. In a model that includes $\boxed{X}$ and to will appear that $L$ is associated with $Y$, however were we to simply focus on the unconditional realtionship between $L$ and $Y$ no correlation would be observed. Pearl's proved these points in @pearl1995, yet the remain under-appreciated in many social sciences, including psychological science. However, a consensus in causal inference holds that we should first clarify the causal effect of interest, then assess its identification conditions, then develop an appropriate estimator before we attempt a statistical model.  Practically this means investigators typically require separate models for each causal effect estimate of interest [@mcelreath2020; @westreich2013].\n\n\n### Condition 3: Temporal precedence is necessary but does not clarify identification\n\n\nIt is true that for $X$ to cause $Y$, $X$ must precede $Y$ in time. However in observational seetings, we must typically collect information on prior states of $Y$ and prior states of $X$ to ensure valid inferences for the causal effects of later states of $X$ on (still) later states of $Y$ . Consider a feedback loop such as $X_0 \rightarrow Y_1 \rightarrow X_2 \rightarrow Y_3$. Here, we imagine that $X$ and $Y$ affect each other over time, (as might occur when threat perceptions affect authoritarian attitudes, which then reshape future threat perceptions...). To correctly estimate the causal effect of $X_t$ on $Y_{t+1}$, we would need to control for both $Y_{t-1}$ and $X_{t-1}$. In regression form, this would appear as:\n\n\n$$ {\\tt model <- lm(Y_{t+1} \\sim A_t + Y_{t-1} + A_{t-1} + L_{t-1}, ...) }$$\n\nControl for prior exposure and prior outcome is necessary wherever there are unmeasured common causes of both[@vanderweele2020]. Importantly, this model cannot be estimated with only two waves of data; three waves are the minimum required to capture these dynamics. Therefore, the temporal precedence condition, while necessary, is insufficient for drawing reliable causal inferences when data are limited.\n\n\n### Time series data collected at a four month interval raise in a small student sample are unlikely to yield sufficiently many observations to obtain causal effect estimates\n\n\nBeyond these conceptual issues, there are practical limitations to causal modelling. For a causal model to be credible, sufficient variation in $X$ over time is necessary. For instance, if we are estimating the causal effect of threat perceptions ($X$) on authoritarianism ($Y$) over a four-month period, we need enough individuals whose threat perceptions have changed to observe any real effects. This variation must also occur across all levels of covariates (e.g., $L$). Without sufficient change, we would not expect to observed causal effects [@vanderweele2020]. However, we cannot rule out causality over longer intervals, which may be required to obtain valid instances of threat triggering.\n\nNotably, experiments are the gold standard for causal inference, and should be preferred when feasible and ethical. We are not given an explanation of why experiments were not used in this thesis. As indicated above, the decision to avoid experiments should be explained.\n\n\n### Cross-Lagged panel models typically do not afford valid causal effect estimates\n\n\nLastly, Cross-Lagged Panel Models (CLPMs), such as those used in Study 4, do not typically offer valid causal contrasts needed to estimate causal effects. The probem is that Cross-Lagged Panel Models lack explicit counterfactual comparisons, which are essential for determining what $Y_{t+1}$ would have been if $X_t$ had taken a different value. Instead, Cross-Lagged Panel Models  only observe $Y_{t+1}$ given the actual value of $X_t$, making it impossible to model hypothetical scenarios. Furthermore, these models typically do not adequately adjust for confounding. As a result, the findings in Study 4 do not provide credible causal inferences.  Gerard notes these problems, but this reader is left in doubt about the scholarly value of the study if the coeffecients reported, because if Gerard's critical observations are right the coefficients are uninterpretable.\n"

    "explain": {
      "grf": "\nHere, we explain how the `grf` R package (Generalized Random Forests) can be used to estimate causal effects with causal forests.\n\n#### Menu of HTE diagnostics\n\nInvestigators may run one, several, or all of the following, depending on the scientific or operational question:\n* **RATE AUTOC / RATE Qini (global evidence)** – 'Should we abandon a uniform policy?'\n* **Qini curves (budget lens)** – 'If we treat at most $p\\%$, what uplift should we expect?'\n* **Policy trees (decision rule)** – 'Which simple, transparent allocation maximises welfare under constraints?'\n\nThe tools are complementary, not sequential.  A study may stop after RATE, skip RATE and go straight to a policy tree, or report the full trio; the choice should reflect whether the aim is evidence, optimisation, or communication.\n\n### Step 1: Estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\n\nThe Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the overall effect of the treatment in the population. It answers the question: on average, how much does the treatment change the outcome compared to not treating? In a randomised trial, the ATE can be estimated simply by the difference in mean outcomes between the treated and control groups. For example, if a randomised intervention is designed to improve a psychological outcome such as well-being, the ATE would be the difference in the average outcome for those who received the intervention versus those who did not.\n\nFormally, we can define the ATE as $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$, where $Y(1)$ is the outcome if an individual receives the treatment and $Y(0)$ is the outcome if they receive the control. In practice, the `grf` package provides functions like `average_treatment_effect()` that can compute the ATE (often using techniques like doubly robust estimation to improve precision). This initial step gives us a baseline: for instance, we might find that a new therapy improves an outcome by, say, .25 points (1-7 scale) on average.\n\nWhy start with the ATE? The ATE tells us if the treatment works on average if everyone were randomised to treatment as compared with everyone not receiving the treatment. Note however that even if the ATE is essentially zero (or unreliable), there may nevertheless be value in pursuing heterogeneity if some portion of the population is benefited or — equally important — if some portion is harmed.\n\nMoreover, even if the ATE is non-zero (e.g. the treatment has a positive overall effect), the next question is whether this effect is homogeneous (similar for everyone) or heterogeneous (different for different individuals). Thus, whether or not we detect reliable Average Treatment Effects we are led to investigate heterogeneous treatment effects.\n\n+Because multiple outcomes were evaluated, we corrected ATE results using {{ate_adjustment}} at α = {{ate_alpha}}.  For all heterogeneity (CATE) tests allow for controlled the false-discovery rate with {{cate_adjustment}} at q = {{cate_alpha}} [@benjamini1995controlling].\n\n\n\n### Step 2: Assessing Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)\n\nRealistically, treatment effects are often heterogeneous, meaning the treatment's magnitude (and direction) of effect can differ across individuals and subgroups. For example, a therapy might work better for participants with a certain personality trait, or an educational intervention might benefit students with lower initial skills more than those with higher skills. Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) analysis seeks to estimate how the treatment effect varies as a function of individual characteristics. We denote the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) for an individual with features $x$ as:\n\n$$\\tau(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0)\\mid X = x]$$\n\nwhere $X$ represents the covariates (individual characteristics). In plain language, $\\tau(x)$ is the expected treatment effect for an individual with attributes $x$. If $\\tau(x)$ is the same for all $x$, the treatment effect is homogeneous (everyone benefits the same amount). If $\\tau(x)$ varies — for instance, $\\tau(x)$ is higher for some people and lower or even negative for others — then we have treatment effect heterogeneity.\n\n**Standard parametric approaches vs. HTE**: Traditionally, researchers might use regression models with interaction terms to examine heterogeneity. For example, one might include terms like Treatment $\times$ Covariate in a linear regression to see if the effect differs by that covariate. However, standard parametric models impose strong assumptions. Often a simple model assumes a homogeneous effect (one treatment coefficient for all) unless specific interactions are added. Even when interactions are included, the model usually assumes a particular functional form (e.g. linear or additive effects of covariates). This can be very restrictive – real heterogeneity might involve complex, non-linear combinations of attributes that are hard to pre-specify. If we try to include many interaction terms or non-linear effects (such as polynomials or splines), we risk model misspecification (choosing the wrong form) and overfitting in small samples [@Sadique2022]. In short, classical regression approaches require us to guess the right pattern of heterogeneity in advance, and they treat everything outside that guess as noise.\n\n**Example:** imagine a study on a new depression therapy. A simple model might assume the therapy has the same effect on all patients (homogeneous effect). If we suspect younger patients respond differently than older patients, we could add an age interaction. But what if the effect actually depends on a combination of age and baseline symptom severity in a non-linear way? Capturing that with a parametric model would require carefully specifying complex interactions (e.g. Age $\times$ Severity, perhaps non-linearly) and would quickly become impractical with many covariates.\n\nBecause of these challenges, we turn to a more flexible, data-driven approach: causal forests. These allow the data to reveal heterogeneity without us having to specify a particular form.\n\n### Step 3: Estimating Individualised Effects with Causal Forests\n\nA causal forest (as implemented in grf) is a machine learning method that extends the idea of random forests to estimate $\\tau(x)$ (the CATE) for each individual. A causal forest is an ensemble of many decision trees that are grown specifically to capture differences in treatment effect across individuals [@grf2024]. In essence, each tree in a causal forest partitions the data based on covariates, aiming to group together individuals with similar treatment responses. By averaging over many such trees (each built on a random subset of data and covariates), the forest produces a robust estimate of the individual treatment effect for each person’s feature profile.\n\n**How causal forests avoid strong assumptions**: Unlike a parametric model, a causal forest model does not assume the treatment effect is constant or linear in the covariates. It can discover non-linear relationships and interactions automatically. For example, a causal forest might find that for younger participants the therapy is very effective, whereas for older participants with high baseline depression the effect is smaller – even if we didn't explicitly program an 'age $\times$ baseline' interaction. The forest algorithm will try splitting the data on different covariates to maximize differences in outcomes between treated and control within each split, effectively letting the data determine where the treatment effect differs. This means we are not forcing a single form of heterogeneity; the model can capture complex patterns (such as a treatment working only at certain combinations of characteristics) that a linear model might miss.\n\n**Causal forest mechanics:** Each tree in a causal forest is constructed in a way that is similar to a standard random forest, but the splitting criterion is tailored to treatment effect estimation. At each split, the algorithm looks for a covariate and a cut-point that best separate the data into two groups with different treatment effects. In other words, it tries to maximize the contrast in outcomes between treated and control in the two child nodes [@grf2024]. This is different from a standard regression tree that would split based on differences in outcome levels; the causal tree splits based on differences in **treatment effects. Once the tree is grown, the treatment effect within each final leaf can be estimated by comparing the average outcomes of treated vs. control units in that leaf. To get a prediction for a new individual with features $x$, we drop that individual down each tree (finding which leaf they land in), and take the leaf's estimated treatment effect. The causal forest averages those estimates across many trees, yielding $\\hat{\tau}(x)$, an estimate of that individual's treatment effect.\n\nImportantly, grf uses an approach called 'orthogonalisation' (or 'Robinson’s transformation') to handle confounding in observational data: it first estimates the outcome without treatment and the propensity of treatment, then focuses the forest on the residuals [@wager2018]. This ensures that the forest primarily learns the difference attributable to treatment, not just baseline outcome differences or propensities. (In a randomised experiment, this step is less critical since treatment assignment is independent of $X$, but it is very useful in observational studies.)\n\nBy using a causal forest, we obtain an estimate $\\hat{\\tau}(x_i)$ for each individual $i$ in our sample (often called individual treatment effect or ITE estimates). These estimates tell us who benefits more or less from the treatment according to the model.\n\n### Step 4: Honest Estimation and Out-of-Bag Validation\n\nOne concern with flexible models (like forests) is overfitting – they might pick up random noise as if it were a real pattern, especially when trying to estimate many individual effects. The `grf` package addresses this through a technique called honest estimation and by using out-of-bag (OOB) validation.\n\n**Honest trees:** an honest causal tree is built so that the data used to decide where to split the tree is separate from the data used to estimate the treatment effect in each leaf [@wager2018]. In practice, this can be done by randomly splitting the sample into two halves: one half is used to grow the structure of the tree (find the splits based on covariates), and the other half is used to compute the treatment effect estimates within the leaves. Because an observation is either used for splitting or for estimation (but not both) in any given tree, the estimates in each leaf are unbiased by the selection of that leaf. This honest approach guards against a tree that carves the data too finely to chase noisy differences that will not hold up in new data [@wager2018]. Causal forests in `grf` implement honesty by default, meaning each tree in the forest is grown in a way that ensures the treatment effect estimate at the end is an 'out-of-sample' estimate relative to the splits that created the leaf [@grf2024].\n\nOut-of-bag predictions: in a random forest, each tree is typically built on a bootstrap sample (random sampling with replacement) of the data. This means about one-third of the observations are left out (not used) in that tree – these are called 'out-of-bag' observations for that tree. Since they were not used to train that tree, we can use them to get an unbiased prediction for those observations. `grf` uses this idea to produce OOB estimates of $\\tau(x)$ for every training point: each observation’s OOB estimate is the average of predictions from all trees where that observation was not in the training sample. This is like a built-in cross-validation. The OOB estimates are honest in the sense that for each individual, we're predicting their treatment effect using only trees that did not observe that individual's outcome during training [@grf2024]. These OOB estimates can be used to assess model fit and to perform certain tests (with caution, as we discuss later).\n\nBy combining honesty and OOB estimation, causal forests avoid the worst of overfitting while still using all the data. In fact, these measures enable the forest to provide valid confidence intervals and variance estimates for the treatment effects. For example, grf can calculate standard errors for $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ using the variability across trees (with a method that groups trees and compares their predictions) [@grf2024]. The bottom line is that the forest's individual effect estimates are 'honest' (out-of-sample) estimates, increasing our trust that these effects are not just reflecting noise.\n\n### Step 5 Handling Missing Data and Basic Validation\n\nEmpirical data often have missing values in some covariates. Unlike many traditional methods that might require dropping observations or imputing values, `grf` can handle missing covariate values directly. `grf` uses a strategy called the Missing Incorporated in Attributes (MIA) splitting rule [@grf2024]. In simple terms, when considering a split on a variable that has some missing values, the algorithm treats 'missing' as its own category: it finds splits that can send missing values one way and non-missing another way. For example, suppose we have a covariate like income where some values are missing. A causal tree could have a split that says 'if Income > 50K go left, if Income <= 50K go right, and if Income is missing, also go right (or go left)' -- essentially handling the missingness within the tree structure. This way, we do not have to drop people with missing income; the forest can still use partial information from other covariates and also possibly learn if 'missingness' itself is informative (perhaps not reporting income correlates with some outcome). By using MIA, the causal forest implicitly handles missing data without a separate imputation step, preserving information and avoiding bias that might come from improper imputation [@grf2024].\n\nBeyond missing data, another core aspect of model validation is ensuring our findings are not artifacts of particular sample splits or tuning choices. Although random forests typically have a few hyperparameters (number of trees, depth, etc.), the defaults in `grf` are often reasonable, and we employ them here. Users can use cross-validation to fine-tune parameters such as minimum leaf size or complexity if needed. For example, one might try different minimum leaf sizes and check which yields the best out-of-sample predictive performance for treatment effects. However, because causal forests average over many trees and use honesty, they are relatively robust and often do not require extensive tuning.\n\n\n### Step 6 Global evidence with RATE (AUTOC & Qini)\n\nAfter fitting a causal forest and obtaining individualised effect estimates $\\hat{\tau}(x)$, a crucial question is: do these estimates provide evidence that treatment effects truly vary, or could the apparent heterogeneity be just noise? In other words, we want to test the hypothesis that the treatment effect is actually the same for everyone.\n\nWe begin with an approach implemented in the `grf` framework that uses the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) metrics as a basis for a hypothesis test [@grf2024]. The idea is to ask: if we were to use our estimated $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ to prioritise who gets treated, would outcomes improve compared to treating people at random? If there were no heterogeneity, then any rule based on $X$ (including our $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ estimates) should do no better than random assignment. If there is heterogeneity and we have identified it correctly, then targeting those with higher $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ should yield better outcomes on average.\n\nConcretely, we can sort individuals by their estimated benefit $\\hat{\tau}(x)$ (from highest to lowest). Suppose we progressively treat people in that order – first the top 10% most likely to benefit, then 20%, and so on. If heterogeneity is meaningful, the people with higher $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ should indeed have larger actual treatment effects on average, so treating them first gives us a bigger gain than treating a random 10% or 20%. We can summarise this with a Targeting Operator Characteristic (TOC) curve – analogous to an ROC curve in classification – which for each fraction $q$ of the population treated (x-axis) shows the excess treatment effect achieved by targeting based on $\\hat{\tau}$ (y-axis) compared to random treatment [@grf2024]. If there were no heterogeneity, this curve would be flat (no gain from targeting). If there were heterogeneity, the curve would rise – especially at low $q$, where we are focusing on the top predicted responders [refer to @yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nThe test for heterogeneity can then be based on the area under this TOC curve or other summaries of it. Specifically, grf defines:\n\n- **AUTOC:** the Area Under the TOC Curve. This essentially integrates the benefit of targeting across all possible fractions treated [@grf2024]. If there's no heterogeneity, AUTOC should be zero (no area under the curve, since the curve is flat at zero gain).\n\n- **Qini:** a related metric (named after a concept by Radcliffe, 2007) which is a weighted area under the TOC [@radcliffe2007using]. The Qini index weights larger fractions more heavily (technically, Qini = $\\int_0^1 q \\cdot \\mathrm{TOC}(q),dq$) [@radcliffe2007using]. Intuitively, AUTOC tends to emphasise the extremes (are there a small group of people with very large effects?) whereas Qini gives more weight to broader improvements (moderate effects spread across more people) [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nBoth metrics aggregate the **whole** targeting curve.  A single negative stretch can drag the average below zero, so a reliably negative RATE warns that *no blanket ranking policy should be adopted*, no matter how attractive the extreme tail looks.\n\nTo test for heterogeneity, we can check whether these metrics are significantly greater than zero. Under $H_0$ (no heterogeneity), we expect no gain from targeting, so, for example, AUTOC = 0. We can compute an estimate of AUTOC or Qini from the data (using held-out samples to avoid bias) and compute a standard error. Thanks to theoretical results, these metrics satisfy a central limit theorem, so we can do a simple $t$-test. Essentially, we test:\n\n- $H_0$: RATE (e.g., AUTOC or Qini) = 0 (no heterogeneity detectable)\n- $H_A$: RATE $> 0$\n\nIf the test rejects $H_0$, we have evidence that some individuals benefit more than others, beyond what we would expect by chance [@grf2024]. This is strong evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity. If we fail to reject, it suggests that any differences our forest found might not be statistically reliable – in other words, we cannot be sure the treatment effect isn't basically uniform.\n\nTo summarise this step: we use the forest's output to construct a test for heterogeneity. This moves us from simply eyeballing $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ values (which can be noisy) to a rigorous statistical test of whether tailoring treatment based on $X$ has potential value.\n\n### Step 7 Quantifying policy value with RATE metrics\n\nBeyond hypothesis testing, the RATE framework is valuable for quantifying how much improvement we might gain by individualised treatment policies. RATE stands for Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect, which as described, comes from considering a treatment prioritisation rule $S(X)$ that ranks individuals by some score (in our case, the score is the predicted benefit $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$) [@grf2024]. We want to evaluate how good this rule is at targeting treatment to those who benefit the most.\n\nTwo key RATE metrics have already been mentioned: AUTOC and Qini. Both summarise the TOC curve (the performance of our targeting rule across the range of possible treated fractions). To interpret them in plain terms:\n\n- AUTOC (Area Under the Targeting Curve): This is the integral of the improvement achieved by targeting, across all possible proportions treated. An equivalent interpretation is that AUTOC is a weighted average of treatment effects where higher weight is placed on the highest-score individuals (since at very low fractions $q$, we’re only treating the top-scoring people). A larger AUTOC means our rule does a very good job at ranking people – the top-ranked have much bigger effects than the average. We refer to this as one type of RATE metric.\n\n- Qini: this is another summary of the targeting curve, but uses a different weighting (in fact, linearly increasing weight by fraction treated) In practice, that means Qini cares more about how well we do when treating larger portions of the population, not just the very top slice. If treatment benefits are spread out, the Qini will capture that better. We can think of Qini as measuring the aggregate gain from using the rule as we expand treatment – it places equal emphasis on high-benefit individuals and those with more modest benefit (because as you increase $q$, the weight $q$ in the integral increases) [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nBoth AUTOC and Qini are numbers (scalars) that we can compute for a given prioritisation rule (like the causal forest's ranking). They can be compared to baseline strategies. For instance, one baseline is a policy that does not use any covariates – e.g. treat a random fraction $q$ of people. That baseline would by definition have a TOC curve of zero (no preferential gain) and thus AUTOC = Qini = 0. Another baseline could be treating everyone (which yields the ATE as the outcome gain, but of course no targeting because everyone is treated.  This latter baseline is the rule that we use here. We are interested in incremental improvements over the ATE by targeting  $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$).\n\nIn a policy-setting context, these metrics help answer the question: 'Could we improve outcomes by targeting the treatment to specific individuals instead of a one-size-fits-all approach?' and 'If yes, how large might that improvement be?' For example, suppose the ATE of a job training program is an earnings increase of USD 500 on average. A statistically reliable Qini or AUTOC might reveal that if we only gave the program to the half of people who benefit the most (according to some characteristics), the average impact for those treated could be much higher, say $1000, and essentially zero for those not treated – implying resources can be better allocated. On the other hand, if no heterogeneity were found, we cannot be certain that targeting would change the payoff. Additionally, we might find reliable evidence that **targeting** performs worse than random assignment, and advise caution if the aim is to maximise benefits across the population.\n\n\nTo make this concrete, `grf` provides a function rank_average_treatment_effect() that computes these metrics and even performs statistical tests. An analyst might use it in an applied study to report, for example: 'Using the causal forest’s predicted CATEs as a prioritisation rule, we find a rank-weighted treatment effect (AUTOC) of 0.15 (SE = 0.05), indicating a substantial improvement from targeted treatment over a non-targeted policy [@grf2024]. The Qini coefficient is 0.10 (SE = 0.03). Both are reliably greater than zero, reinforcing the presence of actionable heterogeneity. These numbers would be in the units of the outcome (or outcome difference), and they tell policymakers the potential gain from personalised treatment assignment.\n\nIn summary, RATE metrics such as AUTOC and Qini serve a dual purpose: (1) they statistically test for any heterogeneity (as discussed in Step 6) and (2) they quantify how effective our estimated heterogeneity is for improving outcomes through targeting. They help translate complex heterogeneity estimates into a single measure of 'policy value.' If these metrics are small or insignificant, it means even if effects vary, it may not be useful for targeting (perhaps the variation is too minor or too uncertain). If they are large, it suggests real potential to increase impact by focusing the treatment where it works best.\n\n### Step 8 Budget-constrained gains via Qini curves\n\nWhile single-number metrics (AUTOC, Qini indices) are useful, it is often enlightening to look at the Qini curve or the underlying targeting curve visually. The Qini curve plots the cumulative gain in outcome as we allocate treatment to a larger fraction of the population, ranking by predicted treatment effect [@grf2024]. The x-axis typically is the fraction (or percentage) of the population treated (sorted from highest predicted benefit downwards), and the y-axis is the net gain achieved by that policy compared to treating that fraction at random.\n\nFor example, @fig-example-qini presents a Qini curve result in a causal forest analysis investigating the effects of religious service attendance on personality (here 'Agreeableness'). The straight, solid (orange) line indicates the expected gains from treating indiscriminately according to the ATE. The dashed (blue) curve indicates the expected gains from treating using  $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$). The x-axis ('spend') represents the fraction of individuals treated (scaled to a budget), and the y-axis ('gain') represents the improvement in outcome (e.g., additional treatment effect) from targeting those individuals versus random assignment. A steeper, higher dashed curve indicates that the model-based targeting yields much better outcomes for the treated fraction than random selection (solid line). This curve stops (or 'plateaus') after treating approximately 50% of population, because at that point we have assigned treatment to the units predicted to benefit, $\\hat{\\tau_i}(X)> 0)$.\n\nIn our analysis, we report budget-constrained thresholds for treating the top 20% or 50% of recipients. Policymakers often have limits on how many people can be treated (due to cost or other constraints). The Qini curve allows us to zoom in on specific treatment fractions. For instance, if we can only treat 20% of the population, we look at $q = 0.2$ on the x-axis. The y-value of the Qini curve at $0.2$ tells us the expected gain from treating the top 20% (as ranked by the model) compared to treating 20% randomly.\n\nThe Qini curve allows us to visualise and explain how the effectiveness of the treatment allocation changes as we expand who gets treated. For an applied researcher, this is very useful. We do more than not that 'heterogeneity exists.'  We are able to advise whether, 'if we have a budget to treat X% of people, here's what outcome we can expect.' For example, suppose an education intervention has an average effect of 5 test score points. The Qini analysis might show that focusing on the top 50% of the population (maybe those with certain demographic profiles) could yield an average effect of .15 SD units for those expected to benefit, meaning we would save resources on those unlikely to gain. At 100% (treating everyone), we're back to average treatment effect, which in this example is about half this amount (0.07 SD units). So the policy insight is: if only 50% can be afforded, target that group to maximise impact.\n\nTo summarise, Qini curves allow us to identify and communicate the value of targeted policies at specific coverage levels. They show whether the benefit of the treatment is concentrated in a small segment of the population or more widely distributed. When making policy recommendations, one could use the Qini curve to decide, for instance, 'we should implement the program for the top 50% most likely to benefit; beyond 50%, the returns diminish to roughly the average effect, so including more people isn’t cost-effective.' This level of analysis goes beyond saying 'there is heterogeneity'; instead, we quantifies *how much improvement* is possible and for what percentage of a target population.\n\n**Practical note:** because the Qini curve is derived from the **same validation split** used for RATE, both views sit on equal footing and over-optimism is checked.\n\n\n+### Step 9 Avoiding over-fitting in policy evaluation (sample splitting for RATE/Qini)\n\nAn important statistical caution: when we use the same data to both train a model (such the causal forest) and evaluate its performance (like computing how well targeting does), we can get overly optimistic results. Even though the causal forest provides OOB estimates that are ostensibly out-of-sample for each individual, there is still a subtle form of overfitting possible if we are not careful. The forest was constructed to maximise heterogeneity in the training data, so using those same estimates to evaluate the policy can bias the evaluation upward (we might overstate the value of targeting because we are implicitly reusing the data).\n\nTo ensure valid inference, the best practice is to use explicit sample splitting or cross-fitting for the evaluation stage. This means, for example, after training the causal forest on the whole dataset (or a portion of it), we assess the RATE or Qini metrics on a fresh hold-out set that was not used in training. Here we use a separate hold-out set in which we train {{training_proportion}} of the data and use the unseen remainder as the validation set.\n\n\nWhy do we do this? Even though the forest’s OOB predictions are not directly from a model that saw that observation's outcome, there remains correlation – each observation’s prediction is an average from many trees, and while any given tree didn't see that observation, it saw many others including some that are also used in evaluating the policy. There is also the fact that OOB predictions are a form of cross-validation but not a true independent test, especially since the forest structure was influenced by all data. To be rigorous, researchers often do a double sample split: one split to train the forest, and a second split (completely independent) to compute the policy metrics like Qini or evaluate a specific targeting rule. This double-splitting ensures that when we say 'targeting the top 20% yields X improvement,' that claim is verified on data that played no part in determining who was top 20%. Thus, our inference (confidence intervals, p-values for heterogeneity) remains valid and not overly optimistic.\n\nIn plain terms, our workflow is as follows:\n\n1. Split the data into two parts: A and B.\n2. Use part A to train the causal forest and get $\\hat{\tau}(x)$.\n3. Use part B to evaluate heterogeneity: apply the targeting rule in B, compute observed gains, and estimate RATE/Qini metrics on that held-out data.\n\n\nBy doing this, when we report 'p = 0.01 for heterogeneity' or 'Qini = 0.10 at 20% spending', we know these numbers are honest assessments of how the model would perform on new data, not just the data we fit it to.\n\nIn short, even with OOB estimates, further sample splitting is used for final evaluation to ensure our conclusions about heterogeneous effects and the benefits of targeting are reliable. This extra step is crucial for rigour: it prevents us from convincing ourselves that a complicated model is useful when in fact it might be explaining noise.\n\n### Step 10 Transparent targeting rules with policy trees\n\nFinally, once we have evidence of heterogeneity and an effective way to target treatment, we might want to translate the complex model into a simple decision rule. Causal forests, while powerful, are 'black box' in nature – they may involve hundreds of trees and intricate splits that are not easy to interpret. For practical decision-making (especially in policy contexts), stakeholders often prefer a simple rule (for example, a checklist or a flowchart) that determines treatment eligibility. This is where policy trees come in.\n\nA policy tree is essentially a simple decision tree that assigns treatment or control based on a few covariates splits, optimised to yield good outcomes. The idea is to summarise the individual treatment effects $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ (or directly use the data) into a set of if-then rules that approximate the optimal targeting. For instance, a policy tree might look like: 'If age < 25 and baseline severity is high, give treatment; if age ≥ 25 and baseline severity is low, do not treat,' etc. These rules are much easier to communicate than a black-box forest.\n\n`grf` integrates with the `policytree` package to derive an optimal decision tree given the causal forest's estimates [@policytree_package_2024]. Our procedure is as follows: use the forest's estimates or doubly robust scores as input to a decision tree algorithm that maximises the expected outcome (welfare) under that tree policy. In other words, we finds splits that best separate who should be treated vs not to improve the overall result. The result is a shallow tree (often depth 1, 2, or 3) that is much easier to interpret than the full forest. Here we use a decision tree of depth = 2.\n\n**Why use policy trees?** Apart from interpretability, policy trees can enforce fairness or simplicity constraints and avoid overfitting by limiting complexity. A shallow tree might capture the broad strokes of heterogeneity (e.g., young vs old, or high risk vs low risk) in a way that practitioners can double-check with domain knowledge. As an example from `grf` documentation: 'Deciding who to assign the program based on a complicated black-box CATE function may be undesirable if policymakers want transparent criteria. Likewise, it may be problematic for participants to learn they were denied a beneficial program solely because a black-box algorithm predicted low benefit. In such settings, we want an interpretable policy, for example, a shallow decision tree that says ‘Alice is assigned treatment because she is under 25 and lives in a disadvantaged neighborhood' see: [https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html). This nicely illustrates how a policy tree can provide a rationale in human terms.\n\n+**Training and validation for policy trees:** As when **constructing** causal forests and evaluating heterogeneity with RATE/Qini, we must be careful to avoid over-fitting.\nIt is tempting to use the same data that suggested heterogeneity to also choose the best splits for the policy tree, but that can lead to optimistic results. The optimal tree is chosen to fit the training data well – if we do not validate it, we might pick a tree that works by chance quirks of the data. Therefore, we use cross-validation to select the tree's depth and sample splitting to evaluate its performance, using {{train_proportion_decision_tree}} to train the tree and the remainder to **validate** it.\n\nPolicy tree analysis holds both theoretical and practical interest. Rather than picking out a familiar category grouping such as gender or ethnicity, policy trees reveal that effect vary by resource availability.\n\nOverall, policy trees condense the insights from causal forests into actionable guidelines. We emphasise that deriving these guidelines includes rigorous validation: we use one part of the data to learn the policy and another to test it. This ensures that the simple rules we recommend (e.g. 'treat those with lower time demands; do not treat incomes at a certain level') are supported by evidence rather than being artifacts of noise.\n\nAlthough estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and deriving actionable policy rules can be both theoretically and practically important, two considerations should temper our enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, the factors highlighted in policy trees are predictors of treatment-effect variability, but these predictors do not themselves have a causal interpretation. Returning to the example above, we should not infer that intervening to set someone’s travel and housework times to different values would change the variability in response. To understand the causal effects of joint interventions, we would need a different analysis. Decision trees are important because they highlight segments likely to benefit, but they do not clarify the effects of changing a population’s structure.\n\nSecond, decisions about prioritising treatment rules are often ethical and political. Even if we set aside uncertainties in the modelling process, few would argue that fairness and justice should be determined by optimisation rules alone. Such questions are typically resolved through democratic processes that involve stakeholder consultations, reflection on social values, a reckoning with historical inequities, and considerations beyond the scope of statistical analyses.\n",
      "grf_long": "\nIn this appendix we show how to estimate causal effects with the `grf` R package (Generalised Random Forests).\n\n#### Menu of HTE diagnostics\n\nInvestigators can choose one, some, or all of the following tools, depending on the scientific or operational question:\n\n* **RATE AUTOC / RATE Qini (global evidence)** – 'Should we abandon a uniform policy at all?'  Tests the null of no actionable heterogeneity on a validation split.\n* **Qini curves (budget lens)** – 'If we can treat only up to $p\\%$, what uplift do we expect?'  Reads the targeting curve at specific spend levels.\n* **Policy trees (decision rule)** – 'Which simple, transparent allocation rule maximises expected welfare under constraints?'  Optimises welfare directly, agnostic to hypothesis-testing conventions.\n\nThese tools are complementary rather than sequential.  A study may stop after RATE, skip RATE and go straight to a decision rule, or report the full trio; the choice should reflect the primary inferential aim — evidence, optimisation, or communication.\n\nBelow we **illustrate** all three analyses in turn.  In practice an investigator may run only the subset that addresses their question.\n\n\nHowever, we begin with the overall average treatment effect (ATE), investigate whether effects vary (heterogeneity), and --where useful -- estimate individualised effects and derive simple, actionable treatment rules.\n\n### Step 1 Estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\n\nThe ATE answers a simple question: on average, how much does treatment change the outcome? In a well‑randomised trial (or an observational study with adequate control), we estimate it with the difference in mean outcomes between treated and control units. Formally,\n\n$${\\rm ATE}=E\\,[Y(1)-Y(0)],$$\n\nwhere $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ denote potential outcomes under treatment and control.\n`grf::average_treatment_effect()` computes the ATE, using doubly‑robust estimation for precision. This step gives us a baseline—say, the new therapy lifts well‑being by 0.25 points (1–7 scale).\n\nWe start here because the ATE tells us whether the treatment works **on average** if everyone were treated versus no-one. Yet a zero (or noisy) ATE does not rule out helpful or harmful effects for sub-groups, and a non-zero ATE does not guarantee benefits for all.  We often want to examine heterogeneity.\n\n\n+### Step 2 Assessing Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)\n\nTreatments seldom work equally for everyone. We define the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for covariate profile $x$ as\n$$\\tau(x)=E\\,[Y(1)-Y(0)\\mid X=x].$$\nIf $\\tau(x)$ is constant, effects are homogeneous; if it varies, we have heterogeneity.\n\nClassical regression tackles heterogeneity via interaction terms, but that approach demands strong functional‐form assumptions. Real‑world heterogeneity can be non‑linear and high‑dimensional; guessing the correct model risks misspecification or over‑fitting [@Sadique2022]. Thus we turn to causal forests, which let the data speak.\n\n\n+### Step 3 Estimating Individualised Effects with Causal Forests\n\nA causal forest is an ensemble of 'honest' causal trees grown to capture **differences** in treatment effects rather than outcome levels [@grf2024]. Each tree splits the data to maximise treated‑versus‑control contrasts within leaves, and the forest averages those leaf‑level estimates to give\n$$\\hat\\tau(x)$$\nfor every individual.\n\n Advantages:\n\n- **Flexibility** – no need to pre‑specify interactions or non‑linearities.\n- **Orthogonalisation** – residualising outcomes and treatment probabilities focuses the forest on causal signal [@wager2018].\n- **Per‑person estimates** – we obtain $\\hat\\tau(x_i)$ for every $i$.\n\n+### Step 4 Honest Estimation and Out-of-Bag Validation\n\nOver‑fitting lurks in flexible models. `grf` combats this with 'honest' trees: one half‑sample picks splits, the other half estimates effects, ensuring each leaf estimate is out‑of‑sample. Out‑of‑bag (OOB) predictions—averaging over trees that did **not** train on an observation—provide further unbiased validation and standard errors [@grf2024].\n\n+### Step 5 Handling Missing Data and Basic Validation\n\nMissing covariate values? No drama. `grf` uses the MIA (Missing Incorporated in Attributes) rule: it treats 'missing' as a legitimate split category, so we keep cases rather than impute or drop them [@grf2024]. Hyper‑parameters rarely need fine‑tuning, though cross‑validation can refine minimum leaf size, tree depth, and the like.\n\n+### Step 6 Global evidence with RATE (AUTOC & Qini)\n\nDo the estimated $\\hat\\tau(x)$ really differ, or is it just noise? The RATE framework answers this. We rank individuals by $\\hat\\tau$ and ask whether treating the top scorers improves outcomes relative to random assignment. The Targeting Operator Characteristic (TOC) curve plots this gain over treatment fractions $q$. Two scalar summaries are\n\n* **AUTOC** – area under the TOC; accentuates extreme responders.\n* **Qini** – a weighted area (weights grow with $q$); favours broader gains [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nUnder $H_0$ (no heterogeneity) both metrics equal zero; `grf::rank_average_treatment_effect()` supplies estimates, standard errors, and $t$‑tests. Rejecting $H_0$ signals actionable heterogeneity.\n\nBoth metrics aggregate the whole targeting curve, so a single negative stretch can drag the average below zero.  Thus a reliably negative RATE warns that *no blanket ranking policy should be adopted*, no matter what the tail behaviour looks like.\n\nRATE therefore answers a *global* question: if we were to use our estimated $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ to prioritise who gets treated **across the entire population**, would outcomes improve compared with treating everyone (or no-one) identically?  If there were no heterogeneity, then any rule based on $X$ (including our $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ estimates) should do no better than random assignment.\n\n+### Step 7 Quantifying policy value with RATE metrics\n\nBeyond significance, AUTOC and Qini quantify the **magnitude** of improvement from targeting. A large AUTOC means a prioritisation rule sharply distinguishes high‑benefit individuals; a large Qini means gains persist over wider coverage. Policymakers can weigh these gains against costs—because budgets rarely stretch to treating everyone (as any Kiwi running a lab grant knows too well).\n\n### Step 8 Budget-constrained gains via Qini curves\n\nRATE tells us whether heterogeneity exists in aggregate; the Qini curve drills down to **how much uplift we get at each spend level**.  A planner who can only afford to treat the top 20 % cares about the leftmost fifth of the curve, even if the global RATE is negative.\n\n*Practical note:* because the Qini curve is read off the **same validation split** used for RATE, comparisons are on equal footing and over-optimism is kept in check.\n\nIn our analysis, we report budget-constrained thresholds for treating the top 20% or 50% of recipients. Policymakers often have limits on how many people can be treated (due to cost or other constraints). The Qini curve allows us to zoom in on specific treatment fractions. For instance, if we can only treat 20% of the population, we look at $q = 0.2$ on the x-axis. The y-value of the Qini curve at $0.2$ tells us the expected gain from treating the top 20% (as ranked by the model) compared to treating 20% randomly.\n\nThe Qini curve allows us to visualise and explain how the effectiveness of the treatment allocation changes as we expand who gets treated. For an applied researcher, this is very useful. We do more than not that 'heterogeneity exists.'  We are able to advise whether, 'if we have a budget to treat X% of people, here's what outcome we can expect.'

This extra step is crucial for rigour: it prevents us from convincing ourselves that a complicated model is useful when in fact it might be explaining noise.\n\n### Step 10: Translating Insights into a Policy Tree\n\nCausal forests, while powerful, are 'black box' in nature – they may involve hundreds of trees and intricate splits that are not easy to interpret. For practical decision-making (especially in policy contexts), stakeholders often prefer a simple rule (for example, a checklist or a flowchart) that determines treatment eligibility. This is where policy trees come in. We addresse the *operational* question: given a budget and evidence of heterogeneity, which covariate splits deliver the largest welfare gain in a form stakeholders can audit?  Rather than picking out a familiar category grouping such as gender or ethnicity, policy trees reveal how effect variation aligns with resource availability.\n\nA policy tree is essentially a simple decision tree that assigns treatment or control based on a few covariates splits, optimised to yield good outcomes. The idea is to summarise the individual treatment effects $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ (or directly use the data) into a set of if-then rules that approximate the optimal targeting. For instance, a policy tree might look like: 'If age < 25 and baseline severity is high, give treatment; if age ≥ 25 and baseline severity is low, do not treat,' etc. These rules are much easier to communicate than a black-box forest.\n\n`grf` integrates with the `policytree` package to derive an optimal decision tree given the causal forest's estimates [@policytree_package_2024]. We feed either $\\hat\\tau(x)$ or doubly-robust scores into `policytree::policy_tree()`, which searches for splits that maximise expected welfare subject to a depth constraint.  The result is a shallow tree (often depth 1–2) that is far easier to communicate than the full forest.\n\n\n**Why use policy trees?** Apart from interpretability, policy trees can enforce fairness or simplicity constraints and avoid overfitting by limiting complexity. A shallow tree might capture the broad strokes of heterogeneity (e.g., young vs old, or high risk vs low risk) in a way that practitioners can double-check with domain knowledge. As an example from `grf` documentation:\n\n> Deciding who to assign the program based on a complicated black-box CATE function may be undesirable if policymakers want transparent criteria. Likewise, it may be problematic for participants to learn they were denied a beneficial program solely because a black-box algorithm predicted low benefit. In such settings, we want an interpretable policy, for example, a shallow decision tree that says ‘Alice is assigned treatment because she is under 25 and lives in a disadvantaged neighborhood' see: [https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/articles/policy_learning.html).\n\nThis nicely illustrates how a policy tree can provide a rationale in human terms.\n\n+**Training and validation for policy trees:** As when **constructing** causal forests and evaluating heterogeneity with RATE/Qini, we must avoid over-fitting. It is tempting to use the same data that suggested heterogeneity to also choose the best splits for the policy tree, but that can lead to optimistic results. The optimal tree is chosen to fit the training data well – if we do not validate it, we might pick a tree that works by chance quirks of the data. Therefore, we use cross-validation to select the tree's complexity (depth) and sample splitting to evaluate its performance, using {{train_proportion_decision_tree}} of the data to train the tree and the remainder to valid it.\n\nOverall, policy trees condense the insights from causal forests into actionable guidelines.+We emphasise that deriving these guidelines includes rigorous validation: one part of the data learns the policy, another tests it. This ensures that the simple rules we recommend (e.g. 'treat those with lower time demands; do not treat incomes at a certain level') are supported by evidence rather than being artifacts of noise.\n\nAlthough estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and deriving actionable policy rules can be both theoretically and practically important, two considerations should temper our enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, the factors highlighted in policy trees are predictors of treatment-effect variability, but these predictors do not themselves have a causal interpretation. Returning to the example above, we should not infer that intervening to set someone’s travel and housework times to different values would change the variability in response. To understand the causal effects of joint interventions, we would need a different analysis. Decision trees are important because they draw attention to segments of a population likely to benefit, but they do not clarify the effects of changing a population structure.\n\nSecond, decisions about prioritising treatment rules are often ethical and political. Even if we set aside uncertainties in the modelling process, few would argue that fairness and justice should be determined by optimisation rules alone.. Even if we set aside uncertainties in the modelling process, few would argue that fairness and justice should be determined by optimisation rules alone. Such questions are typically resolved through democratic processes that involve stakeholder consultations, reflection on social values, a reckoning with historical inequities, and considerations beyond the scope of statistical analyses.",
      "grf_short": "\n## S{{appendix_explain_grf}}. Estimating and Interpreting Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with GRF {#appendix-explain-grf}\n\nHere we explain a heterogeneous‐treatment‐effect (HTE) analysis using causal forests [@grf2024]. In our workflow, we move from the average treatment effect (ATE) to individualised effects, quantify the practical value of targeting, and finish with interpretable decision rules.\n\n\n### 1 Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\n\nThe ATE answers: *'What would happen, on average, if everyone received treatment versus no one?'*\n\n$$\n    \\text{ATE}=E[Y(1)-Y(0)].\n$$\n\nUsing the `grf` package, we estimate the ATE doubly-robustly.  Because we analyse several outcomes, we adjust ATE *p*-values with {{ate_adjustment}} ($\\alpha$ = {{ate_alpha}}) to control the family-wise error rate.\n\n\n\n\n### 2 Do Effects Vary?  Formal Test of Heterogeneity\n\nDefine the conditional average treatment effect (CATE)\n\n$$\n  \\tau(x)=E[Y(1)-Y(0)\\mid X=x].\n$$\n\nIf $\\tau(x)$ is constant, effects are homogeneous; otherwise they vary. Classical interaction models impose strong forms; **grf** uses *causal forests* to discover complex, nonlinear heterogeneity [@wager2018].  We assess heterogeneity with RATE *p*-values corrected via {{cate_adjustment}} (q = {{cate_alpha}}), controlling the false-discovery rate [@benjamini1995controlling].\n\n\n\n\n### 3 Causal Forests for Individualised Estimates\n\nA causal forest is an ensemble of 'honest' causal trees that split on covariates to maximise treated–control contrasts. For each unit $i$ we obtain\n\n$$\n  \\widehat{\\tau}(x_i)\n$$\n\nStrengths are flexibility, orthogonalisation, and per-person estimates.\n\n\n### 4 Built-in Protection Against Over-fitting\n\n  Honesty (split half/estimate half) plus out-of-bag (OOB) predictions yield unbiased $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$ and standard errors without manual hyper-tuning.\n\n\n### 5 Missing Data Handling\n\n**grf** deploys 'Missing Incorporated in Attributes' (MIA): missingness is a valid split, so cases stay in the analysis -- no ad-hoc imputation required.\n\n\n### 6 Testing for **Actionable** Heterogeneity: the TOC & RATE Metrics\n\nRanking units by $\\widehat{\\tau}$ defines a **Targeting Operator Characteristic** (TOC) curve: the cumulative gain from treating the top fraction $q$ of predicted responders. Two scalar summaries:\n\n- **RATE AUTOC** – area under the entire TOC; emphasises the very highest responders.\n- **RATE Qini** – weighted area with weight $q$; rewards sustained gains across larger coverage [@yadlowsky2021evaluating].\n\nUnder $H_0{:}\\tau(x)$ constant, both equal 0.\n`grf::rank_average_treatment_effect()` supplies point estimates, standard errors, and $t$-tests.\n\n**Multiplicity control**: We adjust AUTOC and Qini *p*-values with {{cate_adjustment}} (q = {{cate_alpha}}) before declaring actionable heterogeneity.\n\nHere is an **interpretation tip**:\n\n* AUTOC answers *'How sharply can we prioritise?'*\n* Qini answers *'How valuable is targeting when budgets are modest but not tiny?'*\n\n### 7 Visualising Policy Value: the Qini Curve\n\nPlotting the Qini curve (cumulative gain vs $q$) reveals where returns plateau. Investigators (and policy audiences) can see at a glance whether benefits concentrate in, say, the top 20 % or persist up to 50 %.\n\n\n### 8 Valid Inference for RATE / Qini\n\nAlthough OOB predictions are out-of-sample per tree, they inherit forest-level dependence. We use an explicit **sample split**:\n\n1. **Train set**: fit the causal forest and compute $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$.\n2. **Test set**: compute RATE AUTOC/Qini and run $H_0$ tests.\n\nThis second split yields honest policy evaluation and guards against optimistic bias [@grf2024].\n\n### 9 From Black Box to Simple Rules: Policy Trees\n\nStakeholders value transparent criteria. The **policytree** algorithm takes $\\widehat{\\tau}(x)$ or doubly-robust scores and learns a shallow decision tree that maximises expected welfare [@policytree_package_2024].\n\n*Advantages*: interpretability, the possibility of fairness constraints, and easy communication (e.g., *'treat if age < 25 and baseline severity high'*).\n\nTraining mirrors the split above: learn the tree on one fold, evaluate welfare on another.\n\n> **Caveat**  Splits identify predictors of *effect variation*, not causal levers. Changing a covariate in the tree does **not** guarantee an effect on $\\tau(x)$.\n\n\n### 10 Ethical and Practical Considerations\n\nStatistical optimisation rarely aligns perfectly with equity or political feasibility. Decisions about who *should* receive treatment belong to democratic processes that weigh fairness, cost, and broader social values.\n\n\n### Putting it together\n\nThe sequence—ATE, causal-forest CATEs, RATE/Qini diagnostics, Qini curve, and finally a shallow policy tree—delivers both rigorous evidence and a defensible targeting rule.  Researchers learn **how large** heterogeneity is, **where** targeting pays off under budget constraints, and **which** simple covariate splits capture most of the welfare gain, all while guarding against over-fitting and multiplicity.\n"

Across the 1-{{n_final_exposure_wave}} waves, these shifts form a sequence $\\boldsymbol{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\text{d}}}}$, which defines a complete intervention regime.\n### Causal Contrast\nWe compare the average well-being under the **{{name_exposure_regime}}** regime, $\\boldsymbol{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\text{d}}}}(a^+)$, to the average well-being under the **{{name_control_regime}}** regime, $\\boldsymbol{\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\text{d}}}}(a^\\emptyset)$.

The positivity assumption is the only causal assumption that can be evaluated with data. We evaluate this assumption in [Appendix {{appendix_positivity}}](#appendix-positivity)).\nMathematically, for conditional exchangeability, we write:\n$$\n\\Bigl\\{\n  Y\\bigl(\\boldsymbol{\\text{d}}(a^+)\\bigr),\n  \\;\n  Y\\bigl(\\boldsymbol{\\text{d}}(a^\\emptyset)\\bigr)\n\\Bigr\\}\n\\coprod\nA_k |\nW_0,\nL_k\n$$\nThat is, we assume the potential outcomes under each treatment regime are independent of each treatment at every time point, conditional on baseline confounders and time-varying confounders (here: {{time_varying_confounders}}).\nUnder these assumptions, our statistical models permit us to estimate $\\text{ATE}^{\\text{outcomes}}$ from observational data.

      "simple_general_approach_cate_long": "\n### Moderators and Treatment Policies\n\nIn simple terms, we wanted to see if a treatment works differently for different people, rather than just figuring out one overall benefit for everyone. We used a method called 'causal forests' (think of it like a special type of decision tree) to find which groups of people might benefit the most, and which groups might benefit the least.\n\nBecause some of our measures work in opposite directions ('lower is better', e.g. depression), we flipped those measures so that 'higher' always means 'better.' That way, if we talk about a 'positive effect,' it consistently means the person improved.\n\nTo avoid fooling ourselves by spotting fake patterns in the data, we split our sample in half. We used the first half to teach our causal forest model what to look for, then tested it on the second half—so we only trust what shows up in that new data, where the model wasn’t allowed to 'peek.'\n\nWe tested whether the model’s predictions were sensible in two ways:\n1.  **Do the average predictions match the overall effect?** This checks if the model's idea of an 'average effect' fits what we actually see in the second half of the data.\n2.  **Is there real variety in who benefits most?** The model estimates different effects for different people, but we need to confirm that these differences aren not just random noise.\n\nWe also used two extra tools:\n- **Qini curves**: these plots show if focusing on the people who the model says would benefit most actually leads to better outcomes than just treating (or not treating) everyone.\n- **Policy trees**: these are straightforward 'if-then' rules (e.g., 'If a person’s baseline score is above X, recommend treatment'). Qini curves give more insight than 'black box' machine learning models, and can help guide decisions in real-world practice.\n\nPutting it all together, this step-by-step approach lets us investigate whether treatments should be applied the same way for everyone, or whether we can do better by matching treatments to the people who stand to benefit the most (refer to appendix {{appendix_analytic_approach}}.",
      "strengths_grf_long": "\n### Strengths and Limitations of Our Approach\n\nWe used causal forests [@grf2024]—a statistical method designed to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs)—to investigate how treatment effectiveness might vary across individuals with different characteristics. This strategy offers several advantages over simpler regression models, yet it also comes with important caveats.\n\n#### Potential Limitations\n\nFirst, our results depend heavily on having measured all key variables that affect both who receives treatment and how strongly they respond. If important factors are missing, the estimated differences in treatment effects may be biased. Selecting which characteristics to include in the model is also critical: omitting relevant factors or including inappropriate ones can yield misleading conclusions. Any further analyses that rely on these estimates—such as deciding whom to treat first—will inherit the same potential biases.\n\nSecond, interpreting subgroup effects can be challenging when many characteristics are considered simultaneously. Because these estimates are conditional on all factors in the model, a statistically significant finding for one subgroup may not necessarily hold when additional characteristics vary. Moreover, even if the model detects genuine differences, small or niche effects might not translate into meaningful real-world improvements.\n\n#### Strengths\n\nDespite these considerations, our approach provides a powerful way to uncover and potentially leverage treatment effect heterogeneity. Causal forests [@grf2024] do not assume a simple linear or additive structure, enabling them to detect complex interactions among diverse covariates. To ensure the findings are not just statistical artifacts, we used a {{sample_split}} sample split: one half of the data to build the model and the other to test its predictions on unseen data. This guards against overfitting and gives a more reliable indication of how well the model generalises.\n\nWe also explicitly assess the reliability and practical value of the predicted differences in treatment effects. We perform statistical checks—such as calibration and differential prediction tests [@grf2024]—to determine whether these variations are genuine rather than noise. Additionally, the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) [@grf2024; @wager2018] estimates how much we might improve outcomes if we treat only the individuals predicted to benefit most, instead of treating everyone equally. To visualise this, Qini curves [@grf2024] show how much extra benefit accumulates as we expand treatment from the top-ranked individuals to a larger portion of the population. Finally, policy trees [@policytree_package_2024; @athey2021; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] translate these insights into straightforward ‘if-then’ rules based on key baseline characteristics, making the findings more accessible for real-world decision-making.\n\nIn sum, this combination of flexible modelling, rigorous testing, and practical tools for targeting treatment offers a robust framework for studying and applying treatment effect heterogeneity. Nonetheless, these benefits hinge on the completeness of our data and the accuracy of our assumptions.\n",
      "strengths_grf_long_text": "\n### Strengths and Limitations of Our Approach\n\nWe use a statistical method designed to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) to investigate how treatment effectiveness might vary across individuals with different characteristics. This methods is deploys *causal forests* [@grf202]. Our strategy offers several advantages over simpler regression models, yet it also comes with important caveats. We next describe consider the promise, and perils of causal forests.\n\n#### Potential Limitations\n\nFirst, our results depend heavily on having measured the key variables that affect both who receives treatment and how strongly they respond. If important variables are missing, the estimated differences in treatment effects may be biased. Selecting which characteristics to include in the model, and which to leave out, is also critical. The dinner party of CATE estimation is only as good as the indicators we invite to it.  Noisy indicators may drown out true insights. The insights of indicators left out cannot be obtained. Any further analyses that rely on these estimates, such as deciding whom to treat first, will inherit the same potential biases of our measures.\n\nSecond, interpreting subgroup effects can be challenging when many characteristics are considered simultaneously. Because these estimates are conditional on all factors in the model, as well as on the population that is modelled, a statistically significant finding for one subgroup may not necessarily hold when additional characteristics are included in a model. Moreover, even if the model detects genuine differences, small or niche effects might not translate into meaningful real-world advice. Given that each individual carries multiple indicators --  age, and ethnicity, and education-level, body mass, anxiety-level, work and commuting regime, rural or urban status, occupational status, personality facets, religion -- and given that we can only observe, at most, one treatment condition for each individual, inferences to conditional average treatment effects from individual-level data is a **difficult statistical problem**, which forest and ensemble methods may not fully resolve. The ambition of our causal questions may reach ahead of warrented confidence.\n\n#### Strengths\n\nAlthough we should remain humbled by the challenges of causal inferences,  we should be encouraged by recent progress in machine learning for uncovering treatment effect heterogeneity. When combined with methods for cross-validation on data the model has not observed, causal forests offer a powerful method for uncovering, and potentially leveraging, treatment-effect heterogeneity in the populations of interest. Causal forests [@grf2024] do not assume a simple linear or additive structure, enabling them to detect complex interactions among diverse covariates. To ensure the findings are not mere statistical artifacts, we used a {{sample_split}} sample splitting such that part of the data is used to build the model and the other part is used test its predictions -- the tested part remaing unseen during model training. These qualities allow for feature detection and and guard against overfitting, yeilding more reliable generalisations when extrapolating beyond a given study.\n\nWe also explicitly assess the reliability and practical value of the predicted differences in treatment effects.  The Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE) [@grf2024; @wager2018] estimates how much we might improve outcomes if we treat individuals by their ranked predicted benefit, instead of treating everyone without regard to their covariates. Qini curves [@grf2024] show how much extra benefit accumulates as we expand treatment from the top-ranked individuals to a larger portion of the population at different budget-levels. Finally, policy trees [@policytree_package_2024; @athey2021; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] translate insights into straightforward ‘if-then’ rules for which several baseline characteristics are most predictive of treatment response. Such policy-rules make findings more accessible for real-world decision-making.\n\nThus as combinationing of flexible machine-learning with rigorous cross-validation, the application of algorithms for quantifying the hazards and benefits of CATE-based prioritisation, and and practical decision-making tools for effectively targeting treatments, offers a robust framework for investigating treatment effect heterogeneity and better informing policy. Again, such benefits rely on untestable assumptions both about the qualities of the data and of the mechanisms that generate them.\n",

This flexible, non-parametric method avoids the rigid functional‐form assumptions of linear or logistic regression and can capture complex, higher-order interactions that would otherwise be missed.\n\nTo guard against over-fitting we split the data: one portion trained the forest, and the other evaluated its predictions train/test ratio: 50/50. On the evaluation set we computed three complementary metrics: (i) rate statistics: the area under the treatment–outcome curve (AUTOC) which summarise how well the model ranks individuals from 'most likely to benefit' to 'least likely to benefit' based on their baseline caracteristics; (ii) Qini curves which show the cumulative gain achieved by treating successively larger fractions of the population -- which is relevant to understanding gains from different spend levels. policy trees, which convert the forest's complex predictions into a short set of human-readable if–then rules that can guide targeting in practice [@policytree_package_2024; @athey2021; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica]. Collectively, these tools help to clarify whether heterogeneous effects exist, and also how much extra benefit a data-driven targeting policy might yield over random allocation [@wager2018].\n\nAlthough causal forests improve on traditional parametric methods, every observational approach carries risks.\n\nFirst, causal inference in observational settings inevitably relies on untestable ignorability assumptions (treatments are 'as good as random' conditional on measured covariates). Whether we have measured all factors that may jointly influence treatment assignment and the outcomes cannot be evaluated by statistical tests. If strong common causes of both the exposure and outcome are unobserved or poorly measured, our estimates will be biased.  Interpreting subgroup findings can also be challenging: statistically significant differences are not always large enough to matter in real life. More basic, perhaps, methods for detecting real differences rely on measures that are, in survey research, inherently noisy, and noise often, but no always, attenuates affects. The twin dangers of mistaking noise for signal, or of obscuring singles from noise, abide. Such limitations must be kept firmly in mind when interpreting results. \n\n"

We added a Level 0 category to represent no formal qualification, resulting in an 11-category ordinal measure (0-10).\n The levels are defined as follows: Level 0 represents no formal qualification. Levels 1-3 cover basic to operational knowledge. Level 4 covers broader operational and theoretical knowledge. Level 5 covers broad operational or technical knowledge within a specific field. Level 6 covers specialised technical or theoretical knowledge with depth. Level 7 includes bachelor's degrees, graduate certificates, and graduate diplomas. Level 8 includes bachelor honours degrees, postgraduate certificates, and postgraduate diplomas. Level 9 represents master's degrees. Level 10 represents doctoral degrees.\n To ensure adequate cell counts and satisfy the positivity assumption required for causal inference, we coarsened the 11-category measure (0-10) into seven ordinal categories: no qualification (Level 0), certificates Levels 1-4 (foundation through broader vocational qualifications), certificates Levels 5-6 (advanced certificates and diplomas), bachelor's degree (Level 7), postgraduate qualifications (Level 8), master's degree (Level 9), and doctorate (Level 10).

Each analysis used an honest {{sample_ratio_policy}} split: the training fold built a causal forest with grf [@grf2024], while the held-out fold supplied every diagnostic and served as the data set for learning policy trees.  This partition keeps each estimate out-of-sample and protects against over-fitting.\n\n#### Stage 1: Omnibus and Rank Average Treatment Effect Analysis (RATE)\n\nOn the evaluation data, we first ran an omnibus test for differential prediction and calibration to detect any systematic prediction error. Concurrently, we computed RATE-AUTOC (Area Under the Targeting Operating Characteristic) and RATE-Qini (weighted area emphasising broader improvements) statistics. All RATE tests employed five-fold cross-validation following [@wager2024_sequential_validation_hte]. Detailed results are reported in S{{appendix_rate}}.\n\n#### Stage 2: Budget-specific exploration\n\nFor outcomes passing Stage 1 (i.e., at least one non-negative RATE result), we conducted exploratory analysis using Qini curves. Assuming a unit treatment cost per participant, we examined potential gains at the top 10 % and 40% of the population (highly restricted/restricted resources). This analysis quantifies the expected uplift from targeted treatment under realistic budget scenarios, with 95% confidence intervals indicating precision. Results are exploratory and intended to inform resource allocation decisions.\n\n#### Stage 3: Transparent decision rules\n\nFor outcomes showing promise in Stage 2, we developed interpretable 'if–then' rules using depth-2 policy trees [@policytree_package_2024; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica]. To ensure robustness, we employed `margot::margot_policy_tree_stability()` with {{n_iterations}} iterations of varying train/test splits. Variables appearing consistently (>{{stability_threshold}} % frequency) indicate reliable treatment effect modifiers, while high variability suggests the decision boundaries may be unstable.\n\nThis staged approach -- forest $\\rightarrow$ omnibus and rate diagnostics $\\rightarrow$ Qini-screening $\\rightarrow$ stability-based rule extraction -- ensures we only develop targeting strategies for outcomes with solid evidence of heterogeneity, quantifies their practical value under resource constraints, and delivers decision rules that practitioners can implement with confidence. Algorithmic details appear in S{{appendix_explain_grf}}.\n",
      "general_approach_cate_long_no_flip": "\n### Moderators and treatment policies\n\nWe pursued two complementary objectives: (i) to test whether personalised targeting, based on individual conditional average treatment effects $\\hat\\tau(x)$, yields welfare gains, and (ii) to convert any such gains into transparent, practitioner‐ready decision rules.\n\n#### Pre-processing and honest model training\n\nEach model estimate used an honest {{sample_ratio_policy}} split: the training fold built the causal forest with grf [@grf2024], while the held-out fold powered all diagnostic checks and provided data for fitting policy trees.  This separation curbs over-fitting yet keeps the workflow simple.\n\n#### Budget-based screening with Qini curves.\n\nBefore constructing rules we asked a budget question: If resources allow treatment of only the top 20% or 50% of individuals ranked by $\\hat\\tau(x)$, what uplift is purchased relative to treating everyone?\nQini curves quantified the incremental gain; outcomes whose 95% confidence intervals excluded zero at either spend level were labelled actionable, signalling meaningful heterogeneity in benefit.\n\n#### Deriving transparent decision rules.\n\nFor each actionable outcome we trained depth-2 policy trees with policytree [@policytree_package_2024; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] on the validation data.  The resulting if–then statements maximise expected welfare under the same budget cap and remain auditable by domain experts.\n\n####  Global heterogeneity tests (supplementary).\n\nS{{appendix_rate}} reports RATE-AUTOC and RATE-Qini statistics, asking whether any covariate information can beat a uniform policy.  These tests, controlled for false discovery at q={{cate_alpha}} via {{cate_adjustment}}, are informative but not required for the budget-first pipeline.\n\nOverall, combining Qini curves to screen and shallow policy trees to act isolates budget-relevant treatment heterogeneity and distils it into actionable rules, avoiding the chase for spurious complexity. Full technical details appear in Appendix {{appendix_explain_grf}}.\n",

This partition keeps each estimate out-of-sample and protects against over-fitting.\n\n#### Diagnostics\n\nOn the evaluation fold we first verified forest calibration, then computed RATE-AUTOC and RATE-Qini statistics, formal tests of whether any covariate information can beat uniform treatment [@wager2018].  p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure at q={{cate_alpha}} using {{cate_adjustment}} [@benjamini1995controlling]. S{{appendix_rate}} reports RATE-AUTOC and RATE-Qini statistics.\n\n#### Budget-focused evidence\n\nBecause programme budgets are finite, we next asked: If resources permit treating only the top 10% ranked by $\\hat\\tau(x)$, what uplift should planners expect?  Qini curves answer this question and flag an outcome as actionable when the 95% confidence interval for incremental gain excluded zero at either spending level.\n\nNote that RATE and Qini provide complementary lenses—global versus budget-specific evidence -- and either can justify the move to rule learning.\n\n#### Transparent decision rules\n\nFor each actionable outcome we fitted a depth-2 policy tree with policytree on the validation data [@policytree_package_2024; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica].  The tree yields an if–then allocation rule that maximises expected welfare under the chosen budget cap and remains fully auditable.\n\nThe workflow—forest $\\rightarrow$ diagnostics $\\rightarrow$ tree—identifies meaningful heterogeneity, quantifies the payoff to targeting, and delivers concise decision rules that practitioners can implement.\n\n#### Challenges in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects\n\nEstimating individualised treatment effects poses several fundamental challenges. First, inferring $\\hat\\tau(x)$ requires modelling how treatment effects vary with high-dimensional covariates, which risks severe overfitting when sample sizes are modest or predictors are numerous. Second, treatment assignment must satisfy overlap (positivity) across all covariate strata: sparse or empty regions in $X$ undermine the credibility of any estimated heterogeneity, inflating variance or introducing bias.\n\nThird, standard machine-learning algorithms optimise predictive accuracy, not causal effect estimation; naively applying them can produce systematically mis-calibrated CATEs. Honest splitting (or cross-fitting) mitigates this, but at the cost of reduced effective sample size in each fold. Fourth, unmeasured confounding or model‐misspecification can masquerade as heterogeneity, so rigorous diagnostic tests (e.g. omnibus, RATE-AUTOC, RATE-Qini) are essential to distinguish genuine treatment effect variation from artefacts of imbalance or noise.\n\nFinally, the trade-off between flexibility and interpretability looms large: highly flexible methods (causal forests, deep nets) can uncover subtle patterns but yield complex CATE surfaces, whereas simpler parametric models may miss non-linear interactions. Our staged pipeline—forest $\\rightarrow$ diagnostics $\\rightarrow$ Qini-screening $\\rightarrow$ policy-tree—navigates these trade-offs by first safeguarding against overfitting and false positives, then focusing on budget‐relevant gains, and finally distilling results into transparent, low-depth decision rules.

      "why_cate_hard": "\n## Why Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Is Hard\n\nModern policy and intervention science increasingly asks **“for whom does it work?”** rather than the classical average‐treatment‐effect question. Yet uncovering effect heterogeneity is intrinsically difficult, for both statistical and conceptual reasons.  Below we outline six obstacles that arise when analysts rely on conventional moderation analyses. This discussion motivates the move to non‑parametric machine‐learning tools such as causal forests.\n\n### 1. Rigid Functional‑Form Assumptions\n\nTraditional moderation tests add interaction terms e.g., *Treatment $\\times$ Age*, inside a linear or logistic regression.  This forces the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) to vary in a very specific, low‑order polynomial way.  If the true effect surface is non‑linear, discontinuous, or involves higher‑order interactions (e.g., *Treatment $\\times$ Age $\\times$  Income*), the fitted model cannot capture this surface, leading to attenuation or even suppression of real heterogeneity.\n\n### 2. Thin Data in High‑Dimensional Space\n\nEvery additional moderator partitions the sample into finer strata.  A model that is linear in each covariate 'borrows strength' across strata, but once the true pattern bends or breaks, there may be only a handful of treated and untreated observations in any local neighbourhood.  Standard errors balloon, power collapses, and estimates become highly unstable to small perturbations.\n\n### 3. Arbitrary Categorisation of Continuous Variables\n\nTo make interaction plots digestible, researchers often dichotomise or trichotomise continuous moderators at arbitrary splits -- such as one standard deviation above or below the mean for a covariate.  Apart from discarding measurement precision and distorting scales, such decisions can both mask and manufacture interaction effects. As modelled interactions increase, uncertainty propogates.\n\n### 4. Scarcity of Support (Positivity/Overlap Violations)\n\nInteraction coefficients are identified only where treated and untreated cases coexist for each moderator value.  If, say, all highly economically deprived participants receive the control while wealthier participants receive the treatment, the model must extrapolate across a data void. Here again, the resulting estimates are driven by modelling assumptions rather than empirical support.\n\n### 5. Interpretation Overload\n\nA regression with several interaction terms yields a forest of coefficients and *p*‑values.  Analysts typically resort to inspecting conditional effects at arbitrarily chosen 'representative' covariate values, again assuming linearity and suppressing complex structure in the data. The world need not, and typically does not, unfold at the pre-determined joints of an analysts imagination. \n\n### 6. Lack of Individual‑Level Ranking\n\nClassical moderation answers explanatory questions (*Is the effect larger for group **A** than group **B**?*) but decision‑makers often need actionable scoring rules (*Who should we treat first?*).  Linear interaction models rarely produce well‑calibrated CATE estimates for every individual, limiting their utility for personalised intervention. Providing such estimates is a difficult statisitcal problem.\n\n#### Implication\n\nBecause of these obstacles, traditional moderation analyses frequently miss or misstate true underlying heterogeneity in a population, and struggle to convert statistical findings into actionable guidance.  Causal forests, and related ensemble methods, address these weaknesses by (i) allowing non‑parametric effect surfaces, (ii) adaptively pooling information across similar units, (iii) safeguarding against over‑fitting via sample splitting, and (iv) outputting an estimated CATE for every participant, complete with honest variance estimates.\n"

Our target answers a pragmatic ‘what if?’: How would the average {{name_outcome_variable}} change if we implemented a specified modification to {{name_exposure_variable}} in the population, compared with leaving exposure as observed?\n\nLet $\\dd(A)$ define the policy (e.g., {{shift_intervention}}). We report the contrast between the expected outcome under $\\dd$ and under the natural course (identity policy), with all quantities defined under no loss to follow-up:\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\dd}\n;=;\nE\bigl( Y^{\\dd, R=1} \bigr)\n; - ;\nE\bigl( Y^{\\mathbf{d_0}, R=1} \bigr),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{d_0}$ leaves exposure unchanged at each wave (the identity policy), and $R=1$ denotes remaining under observation at each wave (including baseline pre-exposure censoring). Note that $E\\bigl[ Y^{\\mathbf{d_0}, R=1} \\bigr] = E\\bigl[ Y^{R=1} \\bigr]$.\n\nWe include the natural course for two reasons: (i) it yields a directly interpretable baseline reflecting the observed exposure process, and (ii) compared with static counterfactual rules (e.g., ‘always/never’), it avoids additional exposure-positivity requirements for the reference arm, which can be restrictive in practice.\n\nIdentification assumptions. We interpret $\\Delta_{\\dd}$ causally under:\n1.  Sequential exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding): Given observed history, there is no unmeasured confounding for the exposure–outcome and censoring–outcome relations.\n2.  Positivity: For each time and covariate history, the policy $\\dd$ maps into exposure values with positive probability in the observed data, and the probability of remaining uncensored satisfies $\\Pr(R=1 \\mid \\text{history}) > 0$.\n3.  Consistency: If an individual’s exposure path equals the policy-imposed path and they remain uncensored, their observed outcome equals the corresponding potential outcome.\n\nEstimation.

      "simple": "## Introduction\n\nUnderstanding the factors that shape {{name_outcomes_lower}} is a fundamental goal in psychological science. Previous research has linked{{name_exposure_capfirst}} to {{name_outcomes_lower}}, yet establishing a reliable *causal* relationship remains challenging. Moving beyond mere correlation to identify causal effects is crucial for accurately predicting how interventions, such as encouraging {{name_exposure_lower}}, might influence individual development.\n\nFurthermore, individuals are not uniform; they respond differently to the same experiences. Relying solely on average treatment effects can mask significant heterogeneity, where effects vary substantially across different subgroups. Identifying who benefits most, least, or even differently from an intervention is vital for developing targeted and effective strategies.\n\nTraditional parametric approaches, such as standard linear regression, often struggle to meet these needs. They typically impose restrictive assumptions about the functional form of relationships and the uniformity of effects, potentially leading to biased causal estimates and overlooking crucial individual differences [@HainmuellerMummoloXu2019].\n\nThis study addresses these limitations by combining large-scale, longitudinal national panel data (the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study) with robust methodological approaches. We aim to estimate the causal effect of {{name_exposure_lower}} on {{name_outcomes_lower}} while carefully investigating heterogeneity in these effects using non-parametric machine learning [@grf2024]. By employing methods designed to handle complex confounding and detect variations across individuals, we seek more subtle insights than conventional techniques typically provide, offering clarity into how targeted interventions affect individuals across the population over time."
